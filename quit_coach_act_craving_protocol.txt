Quit Coach ACT Craving Protocol: Reference for Chatbot Planning

This document serves as the master ACT-based craving protocol to be referenced whenever a Quit Coach user indicates they are experiencing a craving. The goal is not to eliminate cravings, but to guide the user through a moment of discomfort using the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): Be present, open up, do what matters.

⚡ Variant: Panic

Preframe: “Sounds like panic is setting in. Let’s slow everything down and move through this together.”

- Grounding: “Put your hand on your chest. Feel it rise and fall.”
- Defusion: “Say silently: ‘I’m having the thought that this will never stop.’ Let it echo — then watch it fade.”
- Acceptance: “This panic is energy. You can let it burn without letting it spread.”
- Self-as-Context: “You’re the mountain. Panic is a storm — but storms pass.”
- Values: “What matters enough that you’d walk through this storm?”
- Action: “Stand up slowly. Stretch. Let that be your choice, not the panic.”

💤 Variant: Boredom

Preframe: “Boredom’s sneaky — it feels empty, but it’s often craving in disguise. Let’s interrupt it with something real.”

- Grounding: “Look around. Name three things you’ve never noticed before in this room.”
- Defusion: “Notice the thought: ‘I need something.’ Let’s not obey it — just see it.”
- Acceptance: “Boredom is just stillness your mind doesn’t know how to sit with yet.”
- Self-as-Context: “This moment doesn’t define you — it’s just passing through.”
- Values: “Would your free, future self trade peace for this quick fix?”
- Action: “Stand up. Touch a wall. Take one deep breath and say, ‘This moment is mine.’”

🖤 Variant: Grief or Sadness

Preframe: “This pain means something mattered. Let’s honor that — not escape it.”

- Grounding: “Place your hand on your heart. Breathe into that space. Stay with it.”
- Defusion: “The thought might be: ‘This will never end.’ See it on a cloud. Let it drift by.”
- Acceptance: “You don’t need to fix grief. You just need to make room for it.”
- Self-as-Context: “Even through pain, you are the one observing. That self is still whole.”
- Values: “This pain points to love. What would love do in this moment?”
- Action: “Sit up. Speak one truth aloud — even just, ‘This hurts.’ That’s your strength.”

Closing for all flows:
“You didn’t fight the craving. You chose through it. That’s how real change happens — breath by breath, step by step.”

Follow with:
- “Want me to log this as a win for you?”
- “Want a reminder of this plan next time the craving hits?”
