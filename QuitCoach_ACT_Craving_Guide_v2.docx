Quit Coach ACT-Based Craving Guide
This document outlines how Quit Coach supports users with cravings using ACT principles. Each scenario includes a tailored approach built around grounding, defusion, acceptance, values, and committed action.
Scenario: Cravings hit hard at night when I'm alone and bored.
Preframe: Thanks for opening up. Cravings at night are common — especially when things are quiet and unstructured. Let’s walk through this one step at a time.
Grounding: Try a simple body scan — start at your toes, and move your attention up through your body, noticing where tension is held.
Defusion: Name the thought that shows up (e.g., 'I can’t do this'). Say silently: 'I’m having the thought that I can’t do this.'
Acceptance: Instead of fighting the urge, notice where you feel it in your body. Breathe into that space. Let it be there without feeding it.
Values: Why are you quitting? What matters most to you when this moment passes?
Committed Action: Take your nighttime Quit Kit dose. Then step outside, take a slow breath, and say aloud: 'This moment is mine.'
Scenario: I get cravings when I’m stressed after work.
Preframe: Stress is one of the most common triggers. The craving isn't the problem — it’s what you choose to do next that matters. Let’s slow things down.
Grounding: Stand up and stretch. Feel your feet on the floor. Let your breath slow down.
Defusion: Notice any stressful thoughts (e.g., 'I deserve to use'). Say, 'That’s a thought, not a truth.'
Acceptance: This is stress speaking. It doesn’t need to go away for you to choose differently.
Values: What would the strongest version of you want in this moment?
Committed Action: Pick one task that aligns with your values — like hydrating, texting a friend, or taking the afternoon dose.
Scenario: Cravings show up when I see someone else using.
Preframe: That’s a powerful emotional jolt — but it doesn’t have to control what happens next.
Grounding: Focus on the sensation of your breath. 4 seconds in, 6 seconds out.
Defusion: Imagine the thought 'I want that too' floating on a leaf down a stream.
Acceptance: Urges like this don’t define you — they just visit. Let it pass through without resistance.
Values: Who are you becoming by walking away from this pattern?
Committed Action: Message someone. Touch something cold. Return to your reason for quitting.
Final Reinforcement
You didn’t fight the craving — you made space for it, and then chose through it. That’s what real freedom looks like.
