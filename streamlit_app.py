# Overview message with Quit Kit structure

Quit Kit is a targeted, three-dose daily supplement regimen designed to support individuals transitioning away from kratom and opioid dependence.

It helps restore balance to the brain and body by:
- Replenishing neurotransmitters
- Reducing cravings
- Stabilizing mood
- Promoting restorative sleep

Dosing schedule:
- Morning Dose: Upon waking â€” energy, cognition, mood
- Afternoon Dose: 5â€“6 hours later â€” stress, cravings, neurotransmitter support
- Nighttime Dose: 30â€“60 minutes before bed â€” relaxation and sleep
