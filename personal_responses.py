        "question": "I can’t sleep at all.",
        "response": """First of all, this isn't something to be alarmed about. This is very normal. It's difficult to short-circuit this or to have a shortcut to getting sleep because usually in order to get to sleep, you've had to take a substance that convinces your mind that it has what it needs in order to go to sleep. Now that you're not taking that substance, your brain is going to wonder where it is and therefore will not naturally start the sleep-wake cycle. However, the Quit Kit comes in with GABA, magnesium, melatonin, L-tryptophan, and vitamin C to act as a one-two punch for first of all getting you relaxed and secondly putting you into a deep sleep. Your first night trying to sleep might be a little rough. It might take you a little while to fall asleep. You might wake up several times. Don't worry, that's all normal. But as time goes on, your sleep will improve more and more and more and the Quit Kit is there to systematically put you into a relaxed and sleepy state of mind."""

        "question": "I’m having horrible restless legs.",
        "response": """This is a very common symptom from kratom and opioid addiction when you get into withdrawals and outside of prescription medicine, it will be difficult to directly address it. However, the combination of magnesium and GABA will likely have a positive effect here and help relax those restless legs. If you do have horrible restless legs that keep you awake, don't be afraid to talk to a healthcare professional who might be able to get you something that is designed for relieving this symptom such as GABApentin."""

    3: {
        "question": "My body aches and I can’t get comfortable.",
        "response": """This is likely due to the fact that if you've been stimulating your opioid receptors exogenously, then your body is both storing less endorphins, which are your body's natural painkillers, and your endorphins are not able to have the same high impact that they would if you weren't artificially stimulating your opioid receptors. So if you suddenly stop taking the drug that is stimulating your opioid receptors and therefore bringing some sort of pain relief, you now have less endorphins and they hit less hard. The good news is this is completely temporary and your body is working hard behind the scenes to restock the proper supply of endorphins and turn up the regulation of the opioid receptors so that the endorphins hit as hard as they should. This means that even after a few days, your natural pain killing part of your nervous system is going to be back in good shape or at least on its way to good shape and your body aches will slowly start to disappear and you will be able to get comfortable. In the meantime, ibuprofen is a good way to mitigate some of that pain."""

        "response": """Temperature fluctuations are very normal when you're going through withdrawals. Just make sure that you have clean clothes set up for you ahead of time when you do quit so that you can change if one pair of clothes gets too sweaty or be around a shower as much as you can if you need to cool down or heat up. This will wear off. It is completely temporary. It's just your brain trying to figure out what's going on with you now that you've stopped taking an addictive chemical. As for your stomach, opioid addiction and alcohol addiction wreak havoc on the lining of your stomach and your intestines, destroying proper balance of your good gut microbiome, your good bacteria. This means that your stomach can ache. It means that you will absorb less nutrients than normal and instead of having a proper stomach, it might hurt. The good news is in the quit kit, the morning dose, you have a mixture of pre and probiotics, which will immediately work to restore the gut microbiome and get your stomach back to normal."""

The only way that you fail when quitting a drug is when you stop trying to quit. A quit and failure are not related unless you stop trying to quit. You need to make a habit of breaking your habit. If you quit and it doesn't take, that's okay. Most people do not make it on their first attempt and that's because addictive drugs are addictive for a very good reason. They hijack..."""

However, once you understand what cravings are, it may make it easier to deal with them. Cravings are nothing less than the brain being uncomfortable that you are not engaging in a habit that you've developed.
