kratom_book= '''Why this book exists
My name is Matt. And I’m not an alcoholic. And I’m not an addict. Anymore. I did have significant dalliances with addictive substances. Cigarettes. Alcohol. Tramadol. Kratom. During the periods I was taking those highly addictive drugs, I was an addict. At least, I could consider that much to be true. I acted in ways aligned with addictive behavior. When I was smoking cigarettes, no night our to a bar was complete without chain smoking. When I was drinking alcohol, no night in was complete without at least getting a significant buzz on. When I was swallowing Tramadol pills, no wake-up ritual was complete without me firstly taking two pills—without needing a glass of water. When I was downing kratom shots, no afternoon was complete without me driving to a smoke shop and buying the days’ supply. In every scenario, a bar visit, a night in, getting ready for work, taking a break from work, a highly addictive drug was ingrained. And certainly, these are just a handful of examples where I took the drugs. I had excuses to smoke all day long, for whatever reasons. I didn’t just drink on nights in, I drank on nights out. I didn’t just take tramadol before brushing my teeth, I took it before going to lunch, to parties, and dates. I didn’t just take kratom as a break from work, I took it as a break from life, and several times a day. 
I don’t do any of that anymore. I look at these drugs with derision. I look at the me who took these drugs as a patsy, an unwitting dupe who got suckered into years of addiction without any intention of doing so. I never wanted to smoke throughout my twenties. Or drink every night. Or take tramadol immediately after waking up and then throughout the day. Or drive to smoke shops every day to buy kratom. I certainly never intended on spending As much money on all of this as I did spend. To think of this is actually fairly awkward. Now that I am sober from all of these drugs, and realize that none of them helped me get a better life, and instead, plenty well destroyed the life I did have when I started taking them, I see that all the money I spent on them was an utter waste. A complete sunk cost. I was paying to damage every single one of my vital organs. Paying my hard-earned money so that companies who were happy to sell me their addictive drug could profit. Slowly convincing myself that I didn’t have what it took to be happy on my own—at my own financial expense. Imagine that: paying money to slowly and subconsciously defeat your own sense of self worth and self-respect. Yet I did. Every day. Whether cigarettes, booze, Tramadol, or kratom, I spent nearly two decades spending thousands and thousands of dollars to avoid one thing: sobriety. 
So that begs the question, if I could justify spending so much money on addictive drugs that systematically destroyed my self worth and my health, what was I trying to achieve? A state of inebriation? No, that’s not it. I never enjoyed getting intoxicated sheerly to get intoxicated. There was something else involved. Some other, deeper motivation. I felt like being sober was…scary. Not having anything to relax myself? Or to boost me up? Not taking anything that would alter my mind and make me feel differently, on demand? Scary. Sobriety, the place where I couldn’t go down to some store and buy something to “take the edge off.” 
The edge. The edge of what? I still don’t know. But I do know this: addictive drugs so warped my perception of my self value and my ability to function in this world simply under my own power, that I became subconsciously convinced that I needed them to get by. To take off the edge from life. The edge that only existed in a state of sobriety. Again, whether there really was an edge worth taking off, and what that edge even looked like is still a mystery. But I was convinced it was there. I was terrified of it. And thereby, terrified of sobriety. Sobriety was a place where nothing would be as enjoyable as it would be under the influence. Plus, I would have no way of facing the stress and anxiety of daily life except by doing so head on. No crutch. No shortcut. No time-shifting my problems out ahead of the high or drunkenness. Sobriety meant meeting the world without any assistance. And what with the “edge” of life and all, and my crumbled sense of self-worth that taking the addictive drugs programmed me with, I became convinced there simply would be no way to truly enjoy life without a drug. 
How utterly, stupidly wrong I was. Being sober wasn’t hard. Being sober was the easiest thing in the world. Being addicted was hard. Being addicted was the hardest thing I ever did, and, barring some extreme tragedy down the line of my life, will likely be the hardest thing I’ll ever have done. Because being sober requires no trips to the store. Instead of spending thousands of dollars to get it, it comes included with your body, for your whole life. No cost whatsoever, outside of the costs of staying alive and healthy. Sobriety has no edge. There’s absolutely no edge to sober life. The edge, or rather, edges, that I was trying to escape came from things in my life that made me miserable. My jobs. My heartaches. My failure to chase after my dreams. My keeping company with people I didn’t really like, but chose to hang out with anyways because I felt lonely. So many edges of life come from the impulses our mind tells itself for the sake of making us aware that we have wondered off the path we’re meant to trek. It’s got nothing to do with sobriety. Nothing at all. Sobriety did not make my job soul-sucking, my job made my job soul-sucking. My subconscious knew this and didn’t relent in sending messages to my conscious mind with alarm bells in the background, “This sucks. You are meant for better things. You are wasting your time here. You need to go after the job you know will make you satisfied, not this job which is killing you slowly.” And I do mean that, by the way, “killing you slowly.” Spending our time on earth engaged in activities that waste our time is the same thing as slowly killing yourself. Your life is only so many days long. You are free to spend as many as you want doing something you hate, but you are just as free to spend as many as you want chasing what you know will bring you joy.
And that is why doing addictive drugs, or rather, choosing to do addictive drugs once you’re aware of the negative impact they are having on your life, is so difficult. Again, being addicted was the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do in my life. Because it is literally a waking nightmare. You are doomed to repeat the same life-ruining actions every day, despite an ever increasing desire to stop doing them. If you’ve never been addicted to something, try to imagine standing between two objects: your favorite food, on your left side, and a foul poison, on your right side. You reach for your favorite food, knowing full well that it will make you feel good and happy. But an invisible hand stops your reach, and a disembodied voice instructs you that before you can take your favorite food, you need to take the poison. You reach again for the food, ignoring the voice. Again, you are stopped, and the voice, more forcefully now, instructs you to drink the poison. Only then can you have your favorite food. You try to reach again, and again are stopped. The voice repeats the instruction, but louder. You try, again and again, to reach your favorite food, but every time, you are blocked, and every time, the disembodied voice more forcefully commands you to drink the poison. “Why?” you think. It’s poison. It will hurt you. It might even kill you. Doesn’t matter. You won’t get an answer. And eventually, you get so hungry, you relent, and sip the poison. You feel ashamed of yourself. You can’t believe that you’ve put something toxic in your body. You might even feel a pain in your stomach and gut as the poison works its way into your bloodstream. You reach for your favorite food a last time, and finally, you touch it. You eat it. You hope that experience will never happen again. But it does happen. Every day. Every. Single Day. 
This is what being addicted to a drug is like. You want to engage with the things in life that make you naturally happy: a delicious food, spending time with people you love, taking a hot shower, anything, but before you can do that, you feel compelled to take the drug. It’s as if you are being forced by an invisible hand to take the drug. Even when you know, full well, that the drug is systemically ruining your life. Not taking it seems beyond comprehension. You simply can’t not take it. the invisible hand is too strong. The disembodied voice, commanding you to take it, is too forceful. You are too weak. You can’t resist. And you find yourself, almost as if you were under a spell, driving to a store to buy a drug you no longer want to take, with money you’d rather spend on anything else. Every. Single. Day.
Worse, this spell is still in effect when you’re engaged in activities that don’t bring you happiness, and probably more so. Things that trigger your anxiety and stress seem much better tolerated when you pair them with the drug—or at least, it did when you first started taking it. Now that you know you’ve developed an addiction, and that the drug is ruining your life, pairing it with anxiety and stress that occur naturally, from your daily life, actually compounds their negative effects. The drug makes you more unhappy than the stress and anxiety from your normal life would ever have made you. And yet, the story remains the same, you are compelled to take the drug. And again, you do this, whether for happy occasions or stressful ones: Every. Single. Day. 
A waking nightmare. That’s all addiction is. This is how addiction destroys your self esteem and self-respect. It removes your sense of agency. It takes control of your life. It sits on you and never lets up. You feel that you are simply bound to do its bidding, every day, possibly until you die. And then, and this is the worst thing, you feel like your life no longer has any value. Because it’s not yours, anymore. Because you chase a harmful drug instead of running from it. because everyday, so it would seem, you choose mental slavery to a substance to freedom from it. it’s a horrific, depressing way to live. 
But, and here’s the big but: addiction is a symptom of the mind. It is the function of core beliefs that your subconscious formed about the drug you take—beliefs that were formed back when the drug seemed to offer you benefits, and far before you experienced the devastating impact it really has on your life. These core beliefs can be altered. Your belief patterns can be changed. They can. They absolutely, 100% can. All that it takes is a methodical and systemic blowing up of all the assumptions your subconscious made about the drug when you started taking it. We’ll cover how that process works in later chapters, but for now, know that even if your brain is still, despite all your conscious protests, clinging to the belief that kratom offers benefits to your life, this is something we can change. As you read this book, you will be exposing yourself to the facts of what kratom addiction has done and will do to you. It will force your subconscious mind, wherein the core belief your formed about kratom as a beneficial substance was formed, to accept a new perspective. 
How will we do this? Well, the subconscious is constantly evaluating the world around you. It is malleable, but you, on your own, will have a virtually impossible time changing anything it thinks. The subconscious doesn’t care what the conscious thinks. It only cares about what it perceives, and primarily, what it perceives and pleasureful and painful. When you started taking kratom, your subconscious found that kratom brough you pleasure, and thus penciled kratom in under the “brings pleasure” column. It then submitted this finding to your conscious mind and went about its business. The subconscious does not go back and erase its notes. As your experience with kratom turned from pleasureful to painful, the subconscious didn’t change its mind nor erase any of its notes on the perceived benefits of kratom. It doesn’t do that. That’s not how the subconscious works (unfortunately). So instead of trying to hand the subconscious a giant eraser and yell, “Hey, dumbass, you need to fix your mistake!” we are going to try a different tactic, one that will force the subconscious to form a new core belief, one far more powerful than that which it currently holds about kratom: that being kratom free is the best way to live a pleasureful life. We will do that by forcing the subconscious to take note, systematically and in plain English, the myriad ways in which kratom has taken over your life for the worse. Slowly but surely, the subconscious will start to etch the word kratom under the “painful” column. By the end of the book, that etching will have become so deep and pronounced, it will be all the subconscious sees when it sees the word “kratom.” It will regard kratom as an agent of pain, and that will allow your conscious mind, which has been yelling out, “This is ruining my life, this is ruining my life!” to be vindicated. No more invisible hand. No more disembodied voice. No more spell. No more addiction. 
And the best part of all of this is what I discovered when I sobered up completely: that sobriety is, hands down, no contest, the absolute best and most pleasurable way to live life. There is simply no debate on this. If you don’t believe me now, you will by the end of this book. The “edge” that I spent decades trying to take off? That’s not the edge of sobriety. There is no edge to sobriety. Sobriety makes you stronger, smarter, and more motivated to attack any edge that the less satisfying parts of your life may bring you. I tell you truly, that when you remove addictive drugs from your life, your ability to accomplish your deepest-held goals and aspirations skyrockets. You become positively supercharged. You become more loving, more powerful, more charming, more thoughtful, more grateful, and above all, more capable to shave off any edges of your life and replace them with that which brings you joy. This will only reinforce your newfound core belief that kratom is as useful to you as a broken leg. And your subconscious will take note. Even deeper it will etch the word kratom under the “painful” column. Where it belongs. 
You are about to take back control of your life. There is so much to look forward to. Let’s do this. 
Why I take it: for the mental health benefits
The first time you took kratom, you felt a rush. Chances are, it came to you as a burgeoning river of positivity, cheer, excitement, satisfaction, calm, steadiness, and comfort. If you were feeling sad, you felt happy. Tired? You felt energized. Scatterbrained—focused. Nervousness turned to confidence. Your shyness melted away. You felt liberated from stress. If you were suffering from chronic pain, it disappeared or was lessened. The big tasks you had to take care of no longer seemed so big. Going to work didn’t seem so depressing. Working out at the gym wasn’t as strenuous as normal. Even if you were just feeling a little off, you suddenly felt perfectly fine. 
What a magical substance. And there it was waiting for you, at a gas station. Next to the cigarettes. The chewing tobacco. The energy shots. The liquor. The scratch-off tickets. The phony penis enlargement pills. The equally libido enhancers. Or you found it at a smoke shop. Next to the nitrous oxide canisters. The vape cartridges. The tianeptine shots. The long-stemmed glass pipes. The rolling papers. 
Strange company to keep for something so magical. And stranger still, how we can go to a gas station, look at chewing tobacco or cigarettes and think, I would never ruin my life with that stuff, and then buy a shot of kratom. Or, we go to a vape shop, stand in line behind two clearly disheveled crack addicts while they select their glass pipe, thinking, I do not envy the way their addiction has destroyed their lives, and then buy a bag of kratom powder. 
Or perhaps you buy your kratom online. You searched for kratom extracts and among the various listed kratom retailers, you saw links to online communities for people struggling with a kratom addiction. You thought, it’s a shame that some people have let something as simple as kratom ruin their lives. Then you completed a $120 purchase for a dozen kratom extracts. 
Remember, kratom is a substance sold alongside such obviously bogus products as penis enlargement and libido enhancement pills. It’s sold in displays behind such obvious addiction paraphernalia as long-stemmed glass pipes and nitrous oxide canisters. Alongside known carcinogens like cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and alcohol. 
Again, strange company to keep. At least, for something that made you feel so, so good. Perhaps you know alcohol kills millions of people each year. You know the same thing for tobacco products. You know that gas station boner pills don’t work. You know these things the same way that you know crack is a highly addictive drug that systemically turns normal people into debilitated husks. That nitrous oxide, or “whip-its,” irrevocably harms brain tissue for only the briefest of highs. What would kratom, which is derived from a naturally growing, Southeast Asian plant and constantly touted as an “herbal” or “botanical” product, be sold alongside products that either don’t work, are known to kill you, or are used to facilitate drug addiction?
The answer is no secret, and on inspection, no surprise. Kratom is, after all, a drug. And if you’re reading this book, you know as well as anyone that it belongs nowhere else but alongside such products. Mitragynine, the “active” ingredient in kratom, is a partial mu opioid agonist. Mitragynine, as an opioid agonist, induces the euphoric feeling that keeps you coming back to kratom. Though you may only be cursorily familiar with Mitragynine as a partial opioid agonist, you are almost certainly familiar with its cousins heroin, oxycontin, and fentanyl. These drugs are full mu opioid agonists. The closest relative in the opioid family that kratom has is buprenorphine, the primary component of Suboxone. If you’re not familiar with Suboxone, it is a prescription medicine used to help people recovering from addictions to the full opioid agonists just listed. That’s right, both kratom and Suboxone are partial mu opioid agonists. The difference between the two? One is sold for recreational use at gas stations and smoke shops, while the other is prescribed to help people quit heroin. If you needed any further convincing that kratom belongs around the company it typically keeps: alcohol, tobacco, bogus sex pills, crack pipes, and brain-killing nitrous oxide canisters, let that be all you need.
Suboxone plays a vital role in helping addicts quit “hard” drugs like heroin and fentanyl by still providing a euphoric opioid high, but preventing overdose through inclusion of a secondary ingredient called naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Naloxone severely limits the body’s ability to bind full opioid agonists, commonly administered through injections, to opioid receptors in the nervous system. In fact, Naloxone induces painful withdrawal symptoms if a person injects opioids into the blood, and in this way it punishes the addict for using it. 
But if suboxone and kratom are both opioid agonists, how come one is only available by prescription, and the other is available to anyone over eighteen? Wouldn’t it make sense if the prescription opioid agonist was much stronger, and therefore must be controlled? It would. But for now, kratom is not a controlled substance in the United States. It is sold in the vast majority of states. It shouldn’t be, I would argue, but I am not a politician.
What matters is this: kratom’s active ingredient, Mitragynine, induces the same effects as a prescription medicine used to wean people of off life-ruining drugs such as heroin, fentanyl, and oxycontin. It does so by activating the same opioid receptors in the nervous system that heroin, fentanyl, and oxycontin activate. That is why taking kratom, at least in the beginning, brings feelings of pleasure and euphoria. And it is exactly why taking kratom, once the feelings of pleasure and euphoria are replaced by feelings of misery and depression, can be so tricky to stop doing. 
You may look at other drug addicts and think, I can’t believe they let themselves into this mess, when you are actively building the same mental jail cell that holds them. We drink kratom extracts, they smoke crack. We pop kratom pills, they guzzle booze. We mix kratom tea, they shoot heroin. It may not look like similar behavior to us, but to them, it probably looks all too familiar.
That is why kratom belongs exactly where you find it: alongside all the other common vices that are either lying to you, killing you, or ruining your life. And if you’re reading listening to this, I am willing to bet that you already know, deep down, that this is true. That kratom is not the magical elixir you first thought it to be. You know it for what it really is: a drug. Nothing more, nothing less. Kratom is a drug. And it wants only one thing: to take everything from you. It has no interest in your health or happiness; only in getting you to continue taking it while it continues to take from you. 
But you also know that you don’t have to do what kratom wants. You don’t have to do kratom any more than you have to smoke cigarettes, smoke crack, or shoot heroin. Because you already know that you are worth far, far more than a simple drug addiction. Even if you are feeling depressed, lost, and devoid of self-respect, you know that deep down, your life is worth more than a slavery to kratom. The truth is, your life is worth more than I could possibly explain. Your life is as precious as any one thing I could imagine. And your life is not fated to a lifetime of addiction. The day will soon come when you go to the gas station and, if you go inside, you’ll view all kratom products with derision. You’ll see kratom for what it truly is: an enemy, a thief, and a liar. And you will revel in your freedom from it. 
Why I take it: I need a crutch
When did we decide that we didn’t have what it takes to make it through our days without some “help” from kratom? I know for a fact that I am no weak person, neither in will nor in stature. My mom would be the first to tell you that I can be bull-headed in justifying pretty much anything, or that I carry an almost dangerous lack of apprehension when it comes to trying something new. Since I became an adult, I have been eager to find the wild, beating heart of life and dive headfirst into it. But, since becoming an adult, I have been presented with the strange tedium of day-to-day life. Buying groceries, doing dishes, going to work, cooking, cleaning, taking out the trash, sitting in traffic, paying bills, trying to save money, going on failed dates, answering emails, watching television, getting sufficient sleep…and myriad other tasks and activities that repeat, ad nauseum. Where is the wild, beating heart of life when you have to get to the laundromat on a Sunday afternoon so you have clothes for work on Monday? Where is the fiery passion of romance when you’re exhausted by the time you get home from 12-hour shifts? Where is the adventure of a life well-lived when you’d rather just play video games than go for a bike ride?
Wherever the heart, the fire, and the adventure I was looking for was, I can tell you exactly where it wasn’t: in a bottle. But I drank kratom to allow myself a sort of forgiveness for not having the wild life that I was eager for. As if, because my adulthood had descended into repetitive cliches, I was at least allowed a break from it, in the form of the brief highs that kratom gave me. 
And that’s not even considering the stress I felt I actually had to manage. Stress of a taxing job, of moving across the country to a new city (which I had done mid-addiction), of feeling like I was letting myself down everyday that I wasn’t living a better life. The stress of feeling like my life was being controlled by my job, or my finances, or my commitments—all things I had voluntarily submitted myself to, and none of which were truly the cause of my perceived stress—pushing me to feel like I was just playing a role in some played-out movie script. Like I wasn’t even the main character in my movie, because if I were, I would certainly be having more adventure than I was having. It’s true that for the majority of my adult life, I have felt like a square peg being wedged into a round hole: my sense of curiosity and adventure being the peg and societal norms and routines being the hole. But it’s also true that societal norms and routines weren’t causing my stress, my attempts to fit into them was causing my stress. I was the one responsible for my stress. And I knew that. I knew it. Deep down I knew it, and honestly, it couldn’t have been more obvious. Plenty of people around me enjoyed their lives just fine, living where they were, doing what they did, nothing about either being particularly outstanding or remarkable. And that was fine. They were relatively happy. Which made me feel both that there was something wrong with me for not enjoying the life I was leading and that I just wasn’t ever going to be like everyone else. I didn’t fit. Not like them. I was square, they were round. 
All that striving for passion and adventure mostly wound up creating stress and anxiety about why I didn’t have the life I wanted. And instead of going and getting that life, I found a crutch. By crutch, I mean something that I used as an emotional get-out-of-jail-free card. A magic elixir that made my stress and anxiety vanish. For a time. And crucially, for a price. 
Kratom was that crutch. For $20 a pop, I could feel less stress and anxiety for an incredible epoch of…fifteen, maybe twenty minutes.  That’s really all the extracts afforded me. Less than half an hour of euphoria that lifted my stress and anxiety and replaced it with a warm bath of comfort and complacency. After that twenty minutes was up, both the stress and anxiety crept up into my head again, strengthening with every passing moment. It felt like each time I took kratom, what I was really doing was holding my mental anguish underwater, but the anguish didn’t sink. It never sunk. It never drowned. It never even stayed down. It floated right to the top. Every. Single. Time. Worse, by the time I was on my second extract of the day, I was feeling slightly nauseous. My brain was fuzzy. My heart rate was elevated. That’s right, for only 60 minutes of euphoria a day, I was fogging my mental state, kicking up my blood pressure, and making it difficult to focus on what I had to do. And all my stress and anxiety that the kratom extracts had tried to drown floated right back to the top of my mind. It was like giving myself a black eye and then trying to go toe to toe with my demons. 
God forbid I took a third extract (which I almost always did). After three extracts, I would lose my ability to see straight. My equilibrium would falter to the point where I could not walk without falling over. I absolutely could not drive safely. I had trouble focusing on what people were telling me. And the third dose wasn’t even as good as the first or second ones. Yet there I was, rendered almost immobile, and most certainly turned dumb, for the sake of a few more minutes of euphoria. I hated myself most when I was in this state. Forget the stresses of daily life, or the anxiety of not living a fulfilled life. Instead, I was forced into an infirm, debilitated state of being, where each moment passed like molasses, where breathing normally became an effort, and most of all, where keeping my addiction a secret from anyone became most difficult. After three shots, I was sick as a hospital patient. Convalescent. I was an absolute shadow of my true self. 
And I did this every day. Because I thought—erroneously—that kratom was my crutch. It was my little helper. It quieted the bad thoughts—for a time. And who could bear the bad thoughts? Life could be hard, and hard on me. I was a square peg and the world was a round hole, and kratom was a blissful, temporary escape from my adult life of mundane repetition. 
The lies addicts tell themselves. The absolute bullshit they convince themselves of to support their habit. My life wasn’t hard. Not really. And I had all the capacities needed to take charge of it and go forge the destiny that I felt was mine. But I let myself be captured by trying to fit into a lifestyle I knew was not meant for me. A mental prison that was all my making. No “society” member forced my hand, made me do the bidding of the corporate world. I applied to those jobs. And when push came to shove, and I either had to deal with my inner demons or try to put them to sleep, I chose sleep over action every time. I didn’t become addicted to kratom immediately, but I realized early in my kratom use that it was a very effective method for getting my mental anguish to subside. Again, for a time. Until it came roaring back, only after I had made myself nauseous and blind, and therefore even less prepared to confront my demons and make my life better.
So how could kratom be a crutch to me? It obviously caused me anguish, far more than the stress and anxiety of my life. And worse, it prevented me from dealing with that stress and anxiety so I could face my demons and take charge of my life. It allowed me to convince myself that 60 minutes of euphoria, parceled out three times per day, was totally worth the mind-numbing, debilitating effects of taking three extracts. That’s 1 out of 24 hours a day feeling “good,” where the rest of the 23 are spent either unconscious from sleep or steadily deadening my senses to the point of being infirm and almost blind. How I managed to lead a life where not everyone who saw me immediately knew I had a problem is a surprise, but I am grateful that I didn’t have to embarrass myself more than I already had by admitting I couldn’t go a day without a stop at a smoke shop for a drug that was systematically ruining my life. 
Everyone who has referred to kratom as a crutch has eventually admitted to themselves that it is actually the opposite. How could kratom be a crutch? Kratom provides completely transient, all-to-brief moments of feeling “good” in exchange for a guaranteed, and much longer-lasting feeling of misery. If you thought your daily stressors and anxieties felt bad before you were constantly taking a drug that numbed you, clouded your mind, made you nauseous, and emptied your wallet each day, you certainly know how much worse they feel now.
And that’s the ironic part of all of this. You didn’t need a crutch to be an adult. You didn’t need a crutch to be happy. You didn’t need a crutch to deal with stress and anxiety. You simply needed to confront the things in your life that made you feel unhappy, stressed, or anxious. That’s what adults do. They have no other choice. No mom and dad to make things better or protect them. And yes, that can be very frightening—life can be quite intimidating—and you may feel like a coward unable to rise to the occasion of making your life into what you know it should be, deep down. I know 100% how that feels. Trust me. But that is okay. In fact, that’s to be expected. There is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling fear. There’s nothing wrong with you. Not even in the slightest. I’ll admit, I find it strange that when we are presented with an opportunity to go for something that we know we want, such as a new job, new skill, or new partner, the first thing we feel is anxiety that “we don’t have what it takes.” But I also know that that anxiety was formed long ago in our evolution to protect us from taking potentially harmful risks. Risk aversion is real. We are biologically programmed to avoid harm. Avoiding harm means staying with what is familiar. But when that which is familiar is not giving us the life we want, the only thing that we can do to get the life we want is face our fears. 
Crutches have no place in this endeavor. No one got the life they wanted by doing drugs. That simply never has been and never will be a success story. People have gotten good lives in spite of drug habits, but every single story with that plot line ends the same way: they lost everything, or they got sober before it was too late. Kratom will not help you build a better life. It won’t make you fit it. It won’t give you courage to face your fears. Instead, kratom will systematically keep you complacent in the life you have, convincing you that you shouldn’t take the risks you need to take to make your life better. Kratom will trade you 1 hour of your day to feel “good” for the other 23 hours to be occupied by stress and anxiety. 
You don’t need kratom to live a life free of stress and anxiety. You need only to recognize what it is inside you that’s causing the stress and anxiety and confront it. Let me be perfectly clear, kratom does not help you solve mental anguish—it causes mental anguish by deadening you to the world, making you sick, mentally weak, and financially drained. Kratom is not a crutch, it is a trap. The longer you take kratom, the longer the life you truly want stays out of your reach. 
Think of all the money you’ve spent on kratom. The hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of dollars you’ve spent on it. If you had spent that much money on any other thing in your life, you would’ve expected that thing to have substantially changed your life for the better. You should be able to point at your life before spending that kind of money, and at your life now, and say to anyone, “Look at all the ways my life has improved!” And yet, of course, we know that it is false. You’re poorer, sicker, and weaker than you were before you started taking kratom. This whole time, you haven’t been paying to make your life better, you’ve been paying to make your life worse. And it doesn’t take me saying this for you to know this is true. You see it when you look in the mirror and notice the fat, puffy bags under your eyes. Perhaps your hair has started falling out, and your skin has become rough or swollen. Perhaps you find that you are constantly constipated, or that you simply cannot fall asleep without taking a dose of kratom. When you wake up, you feel unmotivated, or angry at yourself, because you know that one of the first things you’ll do when you get out of bed is take kratom—just to feel “normal.” You want to get to work without stopping at a gas station or smoke shop, but you can’t help yourself—you stop and you spend $50-$100 on kratom, just for that day alone. You take the kratom in private, or disguised in plain sight, and hate that you’ve developed a habit that makes you keep secrets from your friends, family, and coworkers. And you do this every day. Every. Single. Day. 
Could any person call this a crutch? Thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to live a life like that? Paying for the privilege of decaying health, wealth, and relationships? No. Kratom is no crutch. Kratom is a trap. There simply is nothing to be gained from taking it. The only thing kratom provides is mental slavery to a habit that you have already come to detest. 
But the good news is as soon as you come to see kratom as a trap that only takes, and never gives, you will be able to say goodbye to it forever. Setting yourself free from the kratom trap is the best feeling in the world. It’s the feeling of having control of your life back in your own hands. All other aspects of your life—your health, your financial well-being, your relationships with family, friends, and coworkers—will improve once you are the one calling the shots in your life, and not a drug. Understand that there is so much happiness just over the horizon, waiting for you, so much growth and opportunity, waiting for you to leave your addiction to kratom where it belongs, in the past, and down the deepest, darkest, fiery pit where it can roast and die, never to take advantage of you again. 
You don’t need a crutch to have the life you want. Stress and anxiety simply melt in the face of a person who has taken control of their life. When you choose to put kratom out of your life for good, and you take the reins, call the shots, and make the decisions that govern your day, any daily stress and anxiety become challenges you relish conquering. Facing your fears, taking risks to improve your life—these become goals that you will enjoy accomplishing. You simply have no idea just how much strength you can recover just by quitting kratom. The resurrection of your self-respect alone will make you so excited to live your life that things that seem like big problems today will seem like trivial issues. It’s truly incredible just how powerful a mind in control can become. The first step towards getting that control back is to accept that kratom is not, and never has been, a crutch.
Why I take it: it helps with pain
This is a tricky situation. If you started taking kratom to manage pain, I have no doubt that it was quite effective at doing so. In fact, it may have been a welcome alternative to prescription painkillers such as morphine, oxycontin, or hydrocodone. Kratom is indeed excellent at killing pain. The only reason kratom made it into the western world was because it was such an effective pain killer in Southeast Asia. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea. It’s been used, traditionally, for managing pain and providing a mild stimulant. Not unlike the coca leaf in South America, kratom has the ability to fight fatigue and boost energy levels for people who wanted a natural, quick hit. Traditionally, kratom was ingested in a variety of simple, yet effective, way. The kratom leaf, picked from the tree and stripped of its central, tough vein, was chewed, and its juices absorbed by the stomach. Additionally, kratoms leaves would be collected and brewed into tea, or dried out and smoked, sometimes with other herbs. It could even be crushed into a concentrated, medicinal paste that was directly applied to wounds or inflamed areas, directly making contact with the bloodstream and produces painkilling effects.
In 1839, Pieter Willem Korthals, who was a Dutch botanist working for the Dutch East India Trading Company, encountered the plant and was the first to scientifically describe it to the western world. This is where the term mitragyna speciosa originated. The term applies to the shape of the trees flowers as Korthals saw them: a bishop’s mitre. Colonial settlers and travelers in Southeast Asia noted how the plant was used particularly among laborers to alleviate pain and provide a stimulant, and botanists note the similarities to opium that the plant possessed, and how kratom was used when opium was in short supply or banned outright in colonial territories. 
By the early 1900s, chemical researchers has isolated the alkaloids in kratom that served as the plant’s psychoactive ingredients. The primary, and most abundant, alkaloid was and is Mitragynine. Mitragynine, while not an opiate (since it does not derive from the poppy plant), and not technically an opioid (since it is not synthesized in a lab), nonetheless possesses a distinctly opioid-like profile. In early studies, Mitragynine was hailed as a less-harmful alternative to opium and opioids, and as a potential natural remedy for opium addiction. However, during the same time period, the rise of cocaine and heroin as popular painkilling methods overshadowed that of kratom, and thus, kratom never made it into the popular pain-management drug panoply that came to prominence in the 1900s. Lab-made drugs like morphine, heroin, fentanyl, codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycontin became mass-produced, administered at hospitals and doled out in doctor’s prescriptions to people eager to mitigate painful ailments. Kratom stayed niche, especially as it is a naturally growing plant that could not be synthesized and mass-produced by laboratories. It was available, but not popular, and used as an alternative to prescriptions for people who wanted to manage pain or wean themselves off of addiction to prescription painkillers. This niche quality, and its lack of uptake from the medical community as an “official” pain management method, kept it from receiving the same attention that other drugs got, and therefore, was not studied with the same rigor. If you’re wondering how an addictive substance like kratom can end up in a gas station or smoke shop, while addictive substances like heroin and morphine are most certainly not, this is why. While pharmaceutical drugs became increasingly studied and controlled by the government, kratom did not. It instead remained off the radar, from a regulatory sense. It remained, similarly, regarded as an alternative medicine, an all-natural way to combat pain or boost energy. In fact, kratom was often marketed as a health-conscious way to fight chronic pain, as well as reduce stress and fatigue. E-commerce stores sold kratom in much the same ways as it is sold today: in bulk powder, in capsules, as a tea. Conspicuously missing were the extract shots, the 7-hydroxy pills, the “tonics” with concentrated levels of Mitragynine far in excess of that which naturally occurs in the kratom plant. 
Only recently has humanity figured out how to take a plant with a pharmaceutical profile similar to opium and synthesize it to form highly-concentrated, uber-addictive substances. Ironically, the opioid crisis of the 2000s and 2010s played a vital role in shaping the demand for kratom products. Those suffering from debilitating addictions to prescription painkillers sought an alternative, a way to manage the addiction and the brutal withdrawal symptoms they would face if they tried to quit. Kratom was a natural fit for this demand. It was an all-natural product, no prescription needed.
Kratom’s popularity, as well as its reputation for being a safe alternative to prescription painkillers, grew. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, demand for kratom products increased, and its presence shifted from primarily e-commerce to brick and mortar shops. Kratom capsules and extracts had a shelf life that allowed for effective inventory management from resellers, and users found the packs of pills and tiny extract bottles a convenient size, further fueling growth. Above all, kratom showed promise as a high-margin product. This is the primary reason why gas stations, of all places, have taken to supplying their customers with this addictive product. Margins on gasoline are notoriously slim, and much of the operating profit gas stations make is from “vice” products like tobacco and alcohol. We can now comfortably add kratom to that list. All the properties that made kratom popular for centuries, pain relief, energy boosts, stimulation, these are all highly-leveraged marketing tactics aimed straight at consumers who have absolutely no familiarity with the opium-like pharmaceutical profile of Mitragynine. And you can bet that kratom manufacturers are going to do their best to keep it that way. Opium-like products sold at the same place that  a high school senior is filling up his car is not only like parading a wolf in sheep’s clothing, but like striking a tinderbox underneath a bonfire. This kid has only just gotten the ability to vote and fire a gun and legally be considered an adult. If you throw colorful boxes and vials filled with a highly-concentrated, opium-like substance at him as he goes in to buy a bottle of water, you are acting with the highest degree of irresponsibility. 
As of the time of writing, there is no federal ban or regulation on kratom products. Only six states have outright banned kratom products (Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin). Class action lawsuits have been filed against kratom manufacturers over wrongful deaths, improper marketing, and failure to disclose kratom on a supplement label. Kratom is sold in coffee bars, in energy drinks, in kava blends. And worse, kratom manufacturers introduced to the world a synthetic version of kratom, 7-hydroxy-mitragynine, that is so strong, it is 13 times more potent than morphine. 
How we went from chewing raw kratom leaves for an energy boost to a laboratory-made kratom product an order of magnitude more potent than morphine, one of the most addictive substances known to mankind, is mindboggling. And to be honest, regardless of how we ended up here, one thing is abundantly clear—the trend of the kratom market towards mass, unregulated consumption from uninformed consumers is a recipe for an epidemic. Make no mistake about it, unless you are only casually chewing kratom leaf in lieu of your morning coffee for a little pick-me-up, you are endangering your life and livelihood by taking kratom. This isn’t the 1800s, the 1900s, or even the early 2000s. in 2025, shots with highly-concentrated, highly-addictive alkaloids with a pharmaceutical profile similar to opium are being sold without regulation all over the county. And nowhere, in any of the gas stations nor smoke shops, are warning signs in place to let the unsuspecting kratom user know that by taking the shots or capsules, they are putting themselves in the clear and present danger of developing a severe, life-altering addiction. Because when kratom sinks its hooks into, when it sits on top of you, when it traps you into a cycle of addiction, it will control an unconscionable amount of the decisions you make in your daily life. It will steal your money. It will steal your energy. It will bring the pain you had when you started taking it back to the forefront. It will steal your self-esteem. It will steal trust from your relationships. It will steal your self-respect. It will steal your health. It will steal from you, every day, until you either can’t afford it anymore, you check into a treatment program, or you reach a rock-bottom point that could include any of the following:
Your spouse leaves you
Your children don’t trust you
You lose your job
You go broke
You become isolated from family and friends
Your health deteriorates to the point where people ask if you’re sick
You lose interest in all the goals you had before you became addicted
Your sense of joy and pleasure in what the world has to offer diminishes to zero
And that’s a point no one deserves to reach. That is the presence of hell on earth. A hell all your making, because you’re the one that took the drug. But not one that you can be blamed for. Because you had no idea that you put yourself on a one-way road to addiction back when you started taking kratom. How could you know? There is no national kratom-awareness campaign warning you that kratom, just like the cigarettes it is sold beside, is an addictive chemical that will steal everything from you and leave you a wreck. 
If you developed a kratom addiction, it’s because you did exactly what the kratom companies intended: you took an addictive drug. And, as a human being, you kept taking the drug. Because that’s what humans do with addictive drugs. They don’t take just one. No matter what point you’ve reached in your kratom addiction, it is entirely inappropriate to blame yourself for it. it’s simply not your fault. You were exposed to an addictive drug. You didn’t know it was going to be as addictive as it was. Even if you had heard rumors or read horror stories online, you simply could not have known how insidious Mitragynine truly is. It enters your brain, paints a picture of a utopia for you, rewires your neuronic pathways to constantly want to take more and more and more, and then finally, when it has you in its control, reveals that the utopia it showed you was a complete lie. And at that point, because it is an addictive drug, you’ve developed a dependence on it. you’ll go through brutal, crushing withdrawals without it. You’re trapped. 
Except, that isn’t the end of the story. You’re still very much alive and breathing. Your body, no matter how weak it is today, can still be as strong as it ever was. Your mind, enslaved to a drug today, can be as fierce and venerable as it ever was, fully under your control. The drug is sitting on you today. It won’t in the future. Because, and this is the best news you’ll get today, once the brain fully accepts that kratom is a perverted little creep that only wants to dominate you and pay you back only in pain and misery, it will reject the drug like rotten meat or moldy bread. By the end of this book, you’ll be fully convinced that kratom is indeed nothing but pain and misery incarnate. Your brain will think of it with disgust. You will be so eager to leave kratom behind you that once you take your last dose, your life will immediately change for the better. And best of all, you will have one and only one person to thank: yourself. It is the ultimate and best euphoria of all, the feeling of having your life back under your own control. To be free of a mental slavery to a plant. To be master and commander of your future. To be you. To be you. 
How do I know I have a problem?
When I was unknowingly developing my kratom habit, I regarded kratom as a magical elixir. While other people were taking shots of alcohol, a substance I knew killed more people in the USA than cigarettes—a known carcinogen that destroys important bodily tissue and brain matter—I took sips of a kratom tonic. Just half a vial and I would start to feel happy, carefree, and light on my feet. I had a non-alcoholic option for parties. Or just get togethers. Or occasions where my girlfriend and I would just hang out and watch TV. She would sip a glass of wine. I would sip kratom. 
Anyways, when I was still developing my habit, I had no idea that I was embarking on a one-way trip to an addiction that would come to manipulate many, many decisions for the worse as my year-long addiction took its course. Even though I knew that the euphoric effects were markedly similar to those of Tramadol, a partial mu-opioid agonist that I had spent all of 2016 addicted to, I didn’t put the pieces together. I didn’t know that I was developing a habit. And not just a habit, but a dangerous addiction. I thought that I had found some sort of missing puzzle piece. 
For years, actually, for all of my adult life, I dealt with depression. Anyone who’s been depressed knows, it’s not something you can simply walk out of if you wait long enough. Well-meaning friends and family can’t cheer you up enough to get you permanently better. When you’re depressed, you’re your own worst critic, and a vocal one at that—constantly appraising the things you do, or don’t do, with a sense of fatality, or nihilism, or pessimism, cynicism, and above all, desperate regret that you are the way you are. I had tried talking to a therapist. It didn’t help. I couldn’t find real things to complain about. I felt like my bad feelings weren’t coming from any viable sources. I just felt…sad. I also tried anti-depressants. Similarly, they did not help. They actually made things tumultuous, from an emotional standpoint. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, are the most commonly-prescribed anti-depressants, and they require a lengthy “getting to used to” phase. Your brain won’t immediately start corralling the serotonin in your head once you start taking an SSRI. For therapeutic effects to begin to show, you have to take the SSRI for 4-8 weeks. And even then, you may encounter drastic mood swings in the process. I know I did. Man, I would go from feeling suddenly and wildly elated to feeling like I was swimming on the edge of a black pit of despair, then somewhere in between, then up and down and back again, on repeat. I even switched SSRIs twice over several months, as if often done if the benefits are not felt after the 4-8 week “getting used to” period. And even though I stuck with Sertraline (also known as Zoloft) in the end, I didn’t feel very different. I certainly didn’t feel more reliably happy and comfortable with myself and my life. 
By the time I found kratom, I had been off SSRIs for about 5 years. The first time I took kratom—again, unknowingly—I felt the euphoria of the upswing of the SSRI. Only for twenty minutes or so, but it was there. And instead of falling into a black pit of despair when the upswing slowly came back down to normal, I felt relatively like my baseline self. What did this mean? It meant (so I thought) that I had found an answer to my depression. A real, on-demand solution that would pick me up when I needed a boost, and not drag me to the depths of emotional hell once I came down. 
And that, more than anything, is what drew me to kratom. Even by the time I found out what I was really taking, months after my first dose, I didn’t really care that it hadn’t been kava giving me that high. I figured, well, if it’s kratom, so what? I’ll just buy pure kratom extracts without the dilutive kava blend. More punch. More efficient dosing. A better upswing from my depression. 
Again, I should have known. I really should have. And to an extent, I am sure I did. Because I began to take it casually, every day. I recall one Sunday afternoon, as I’m reading a book and lying on my couch, thinking, “Hey, wouldn’t this be better with some kratom?” And of course the answer I gave myself, without premeditation, was, “Yes!” My mind jumped for joy at the thought of spicing up the relatively dull and mundane Sunday afternoon activity I was engaged with—reading a book about business—with my anti-depression magical elixir. Everything felt better with kratom. When I was on an upswing, away from my normal state, everything, even mundane activities, was just better. But, I also thought, “It’s just a Sunday afternoon, and I’m already relaxed, reading, laying down, shoes off…do I really want to get dressed for the cold, put shoes on, make up an excuse to my girlfriend about needing to go out, drive all the way to the store, and spend $30? Just for a twenty-minute upswing?” My brain answered with a tepid, “No. Actually, that sounds like a waste of time.” 
This is when I knew I was starting to have a problem. Because even though I knew it was a waste of time, and effort, and money(!), I still did it. And when I came home, I didn’t pick up my book and continue reading. I played video games. Even though I wanted to finish that book. But you can’t waste a good opioid high on a book about business management. Can you?
Fast forward a few months, and it’s 8:30 am, and I’m at work. Every morning at work, I have a meeting with a fabricator team. I’m the project engineer on a chemical reactor buildout, and we are way, way behind schedule. The fabricator team is led by Mike. He’s in charge of taking all the plans that my team create that govern the design of the reactor and actually building it. My team plans and designs, fabrication builds. But Mike was about the most unpleasant person in the whole company. He had very little respect for me, my team, and the company. His demeanor was perpetually confrontational. His favorite word was “No.” He didn’t offer solutions, but was happy to destroy any that I offered up. The delay in the project was pinned to his team and the constant need he had for refining the plans my team made. He had also just been placed in charge of the fabrication team after his superior had retired. His superior, Charles, was one of the most beloved employees at the company. Whip smart, incredibly friendly, and always solution-oriented. Mike, with his new position, and his new power over the fabrication team, was terrified of making any mistakes that would reflect poorly on his team, and more importantly, on him. He also had no leadership experience. It showed. 
Working with Mike was painful. It was slow. It was demoralizing. No one liked the daily morning meetings we had with him, and almost no one ever joined outside of the required handful from my team, even if there was something crucial to discuss. But every day, we did the meetings. By the time they ended, 9:00 am, both my and Mike’s team had our marching orders for the day, but both Mike and I left the meetings in sour moods. I would go upstairs, sip my coffee, and try to forget my anger and frustration by focusing on emails. 
Then, one day, I realized something that would change my morning routine at that company forever. I realized I had a way to side-step those negative emotions. I realized that I had a get-out-of-jail-free card that I could play after Mike stepped all over my team’s ideas and left us frustrated to start our workday. I could get in my car, drive to a corner shop, buy some kratom extracts, and by the time I got back to the office, I would be in high spirits. I would be on that upswing! Mike couldn’t bring me down if I had a guaranteed way to get up. 
So one morning, that’s what I did. I told anyone who needed to know that I was off to a meeting. Then I walked to my car, drove 8 minutes to the corner shop I knew sold the kratom vials I wanted, spent $30-$40 on a day’s supply, got back in my car, and immediately downed a vial. By the time I got back to the office, 8 minutes later, I could feel the drink working its magic. I was on the upswing. Forget Mike. I was feeling good. And I only lost twenty minutes going back and forth to the corner store. I drank the rest of the vials throughout the day, trying to space them out enough to keep a perpetual good mood. 
By the end of the day, despite the great start, I was feeling ill. I didn’t want to drink another vial. It was clear to me that even though the first vial brought me into a good mood, the second and third had made my stomach start to churn. My body didn’t want another shot of kratom. But I didn’t listen to my body. I listened instead to my subconscious, which was telling me I should take another vial and deal with any stomach pains—the high would be worth it. So, I went to the men’s room and downed another vial. It was disgusting. My stomach threatened to vomit. I held it down. I remember closing my eyes to help quelch the chaos in my gut. It was nauseating. It felt like the nights in college when I had taken one too many shots, and if I didn’t concentrate hard enough and keep still, I would throw up into a nearby sink or garden. 
A couple moments later, my stomach had quieted down. I looked in the mirror. I looked disheveled. I looked like I felt: rough. But no matter, I thought, soon I’d be on the upswing and be feeling great. Except the ensuing upswing came and left so quickly that I barely had time to enjoy it. I soon found out that kratom extracts were like that. Because even though I was engaging in a behavior that had me reminiscing of nights being sick in college parties, I started going to that corner shop after every morning meeting with Mike. And the results were just like the first day I did it. The initial vial of kratom would feel relatively stronger than those taken later on. Enough to make me look forward to it after a perpetually stressful half hour with Mike. The last shots of the day, however, would make me feel sick, and hit nowhere near as hard as the first. 
I did this everyday. At first, I relished the chance to use company time to drive in the California sunlight and go find a stress reliever. It felt almost like a covert operation, something exciting and all mine. A secret way to become a better version of myself that was impervious to the bad mood that Mike gave everyone each morning. 
Far from it. what I was doing was developing a drug addiction. Indeed, one morning, I thought to myself, “You’re developing a habit. This is something you may have trouble stopping doing someday.” That someday seemed far off. And I hadn’t really seen the dangers that kratom could wreak on a life. I didn’t heed the warning my conscious brain was telling me. I just kept on going to the corner shop, getting my magical elixir, and getting back to work without anyone knowing. 
Looking back at that behavior, I know that if I had seen a coworker doing the same thing, I would’ve voiced my concern to them. I would have warned them that this kind of thing was textbook addict behavior. That no matter what they thought of the consequences, they were doing something they would sincerely regret one day. Incredible how we don’t heed the warnings we would have absolutely no trouble giving to someone else. If I had seen a coworker I was particularly close with taking those morning joyrides, I would’ve given them a borderline intervention. And eventually, when one afternoon after taking my third vial of the day, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw someone who looked like they’d just stepped out of a boxing ring—blurry, bloodshot eyes, purple bags under the eyes, swollen sweaty, skin—I knew, really knew, that I had gotten myself into a dangerous situation. I was addicted to something that was causing me to shirk work, spend thousands of dollars, destroy my health, keep secrets from people I worked with and from my girlfriend, and all for utterly transient highs that decreased in efficiency throughout the day. I was destroying my life. And I saw it all at once, undeniably, when I saw my beat-up reflection in the mirror. 
But did I stop going to the corner store? No. not really. Maybe for a few days. Until my cravings for another hit took over. I gave up the Feel Frees in favor of OPMS shots and extract powders. This helped me feel less sick by the end of the day, but it did nothing but further enable my habit. The extract powder looks like a vitamin C powder and could thus be drank with water in the open. The OPMS shots were so small that they could fit in any pocket without being very conspicuous, so I could take them anywhere. 
I’ll never forget that afternoon when I saw my beat-up reflection in the men’s room at work. The warnings my conscious brain had tried to tell me, over and over and over again, had finally manifested in the physical realm. Everything in my reflection was exactly what those warnings had been telling me to heed: that I was on a path to ruin. And that path was only one-way. But instead of bailing on my habit and taking back control of my life, I looked away from my reflection and went back to work and waited for the high to kick in. 
It could be kratom, it could be heroin, it could be alcohol, it could be cigarettes, it could be any substance that destroys your life and your health at your own expense. They all have one thing in common: they are highly addictive drugs. They are chemicals designed by nature, for better or worse, to have a distinct impact on your nervous system. They make you feel good. So good, that you take more and more. You sacrifice your health, your relationships, your money, your time and energy and mental freedom, to keep feeling good. Because that’s how addiction works. Addictive drugs work because they’re built by mother nature to work. Granted, mother nature didn’t build anything to make a human a mental slave to it, but still, there it is: a plethora of addictive chemicals all producing enough good feeling in your brain and body to convince you to give everything up for another hit. 
You’re not weak-willed if you find yourself unable to fight the draw of these addictive drugs. You’re human. Human beings, as creations of nature, will react in predictable ways to certain chemicals when exposed. Addictive chemicals induce addictive behaviors. That’s the long and short of it. if you’re unlucky enough to be exposed to an addictive chemical, even if you had all the very best intentions or were infinitely unaware of what you were taking, your brain is going to tell you that it wants more. What you do with that information, when you first start taking an addictive chemical, is up to you. But the more you indulge, and the more of the chemical you take, the more your brain gets used to having it and rewarding you for taking it. You are literally sabotaging your own brain. But again, what else should you have expected? You are a human being and human beings are susceptible to addictive drugs. It is not your fault that you kept taking kratom when you knew it was causing you harm. You were simply acting as a human being could be expected to act. 
However, the fact that you are reading this book, and that you’ve taken up enough courage to stand up to your addiction, is proof that you are far greater a human being than most. Because only a brave person can stand up to a bully. That’s not some chemical, knee-jerk response. That’s your conscious mind saying enough is enough, and doing what it needs to do to convince the subconscious mind that you are truly done with the addiction. Your conscious mind knows that it is destroying your life. Your subconscious mind simply needs to agree. And once that is done, the addictive nature of  the drug won’t be able to control you anymore. You will have elevated your understanding of the drug beyond a chemical response to a good feeling. You will know that the good feeling of the drug is really just a disguise for its true intention: complete and utter control over your life. If there’s one thing that makes us human more than anything, it’s our desire to be free to live our life as we see fit—not how anyone, or anything, would want. Drug addiction is mental slavery. Freedom from this slavery feels better than any drug can. And the best part of being free is, once  you have your freedom, you get to enjoy it every, single, day.  
The ultimate battle: the subconscious and the conscious 
There are two fundamental drivers of human behavior: pleasure and pain. They are the roots of the behavioral tree. Everything you do, to some degree, is done in accordance with the pursuit of pleasure or the fear of pain. And when it comes to your kratom addiction, they are the starting places for understanding how your subconscious brain, the creator of the feeling you feel, and your conscious brain, which judges those feelings, work together—or fight against each other. 
When you take kratom, you are fulfilling a very real, and very strong, pursuit of pleasure. This need is focused on achieving the “reward” of getting high—the euphoric feeling that Mitragynine induces in the brain. Beyond simply feeling high, the pursuit of pleasure also entails the sense of gratification that you get when you take the drug. This sense of gratification is fueled by a vast release of dopamine—your brains reward chemical. Both the achievement of euphoria and sense of gratification from getting high play directly into the subconscious mind’s desire to pursue pleasure. 
Simultaneously, and in concert with the pursuit of pleasure, your fear of pain pushes you to take kratom to avoid the often brutal discomfort and distress of withdrawal symptoms. This is a powerful 1-2 punch. The brain learns very quickly, on a subconscious level, that taking kratom produces a euphoria, and rewards you for entering that euphoric state by releasing dopamine simply for taking it. it also learns that taking kratom is a surefire method to avoid the brutality of withdrawals. In this way, taking kratom provides the subconscious mind with the pursuit of pleasure and relief from pain. The subconscious mind takes diligent and copious notes of this phenomena. It decides that kratom = euphoria and gratification. Additionally, kratom = freedom from withdrawal symptoms. The subconscious emphatically declares that kratom is a “good” thing. In fact, it makes your life better in both of the primary reasons a life can even get better: more pleasure and less pain. 
Following the behavior tree metaphor, if pursuit of pleasure and fear of pain constitute the roots, then the trunk is your set of core beliefs. In this sense, and especially regarding your addiction to kratom, I’ve got some bad news. The architect of your core beliefs is, you guessed it, your subconscious mind. It creates the rules that govern your actions. It writes the blueprints for your behavior. Your conscious mind receives these rules and blueprints, considers them, and then decides whether or not to act. But when you have a core belief that the conscious mind doesn’t like or trust, it is at the mercy of the subconscious for whether or not that belief is released and replaced.
Concerning addiction, your subconscious, core belief about kratom looks something like this: “I am not capable of handling stress or pain without help.” Or: “I need this drug to feel happy or normal.” As you developed an addiction to kratom, these beliefs became deeply ingrained in your subconscious. As we’ve covered, taking kratom greatly rewards your pursuit of pleasure by providing you a strong sense of euphoria and relieves your fear of pain by preventing you from falling into the discomfort of withdrawals. 
A person does not form core beliefs about a drug quickly. It takes repeated use. The subconscious has to truly believe that taking the drug always gives euphoria. That driving to the gas station to buy another dose is always an action that leads to the acquisition of kratom. That the only way to get back to a state of euphoria is to take more kratom. That avoiding the mundanity of daily life can be achieved by taking kratom. That stress and anxiety tend to disappear during kratom-induced states of euphoria. That painful withdrawals can be avoided by taking kratom—more than that, that taking more kratom is the only way to avoid painful withdrawals. These lessons can only be learned through repeated use of kratom. Remember, the subconscious takes copious notes as you take kratom and views everything through the lens of two governing factors: pursuit of pleasure and fear of pain. The subconscious doesn’t have interest in taking present day contexts into its well-formed beliefs. That’s not what it’s there for. Contextual judgement is the realm of the conscious mind. The subconscious is taking its notes so it can form its (and your) core beliefs for good. 
Now, this is a fundamentally important thing for a brain to do, from an evolutionary standpoint. There’s a good reason the conscious and subconscious mind do not work in the same way. Simply put, there’s just too much going on for the brain to think about. It needs to constantly be assessing and reacting to the world. This means controlling the beating of your heart and the pressurizing/depressurizing of your lungs just as much as it means forcing you to instinctually jump out of the way of an oncoming car. The body is an incalculably large industrial facility with billions of components that all need to fire in synchronicity for it to produce a living human being. Trillions of actions occur every day inside your body, most regulated in some way by your brain. These actions are auto-programmed into you, from birth. 
How this auto programming applies to your behavior, and by extension, how it helps define you as a person, however, is slightly different. The brain can’t automatically program core beliefs. And since core beliefs govern the actions you take and the perceptions you have about the world around you, you can’t become who you are without “trying the world out for size.” Seeing what feels good, what feels bad. What hurts. What’s rewarding. What’s easy and what’s difficult. What’s too hot or too cold. What actions got you in trouble with your parents and what actions made the person you are attracted to laugh out loud. During all these interactions with the world, your subconscious is furiously scribbling notes and forming conclusions. It tosses these notes, these conclusions, at your conscious mind for judgement, and your conscious mind decides whether or not to do what the subconscious says would feel good, or to stop doing what the subconscious considers dangerous. But the conscious brain can’t edit those notes and send them back for revision. The subconscious mind isn’t programmed to dialogue with the conscious mind. Again, this is by design, if the conscious and subconscious mind were allowed to dialogue over whether everything the body interacted with might feel good or cause pain, you would never get anything done. You would paralyzed in indecision. For a daily life, the monologue from subconscious to conscious is good, it is helpful, useful. For addictive substances, however, it is critically unsuited. 
As discussed, from your subconscious’ point of view, kratom not only provides you with intense pleasure (euphoria), it allows you to avoid extreme pain (withdrawals). To your subconscious, kratom is a substance to be taken, and taken regularly. Through repeated use, your subconscious has collected and finalized its notes on kratom. It has reached its logical conclusion, which it emphatically delivers to the conscious mind: “Take kratom.” The conscious mind receives this message and is left to judge whether or not taking kratom would be a good idea. But it does so with infinitely more nuance than the subconscious. Remember, the subconscious cares about two things: pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain. The conscious mind, however, cares about…well, everything else. The conscious mind cares about how much money you’ve been spending on kratom lately. It cares about the fact that kratom is turning your skin into a swollen, oily mess. Or that your hair is starting to fall out. That since you started taking kratom regularly, you’ve been experiencing new health problems, and you can’t sleep soundly anymore. Or even that it’s 9:00 in the morning, and you’re at work, and in order to get kratom, you’d actually have to ditch out and drive to a corner store and get back before anyone noticed. Your conscious brain can easily and instantly compile a list of vital reasons for your to no longer be taking kratom. Yet, it still receives the same direction from the subconscious mind: “Take kratom.” 
This mental disconnect, or cognitive dissonance, between your conscious and subconscious brain, is at the heart of the cycle of addiction. Because, once your conscious mind has judged that you need to stop taking kratom, and need to stop taking it now, it will almost certainly not change its mind. There will never be a conscious epiphany down the line where you look around at your deteriorated health, wealth, and relationships, and think, “Hey, maybe I was wrong—this actually is the life I wanted when I started taking kratom!” Unfortunately, that puts you at direct odds with your subconscious. It produces uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. It pits the conscious mind against the subconscious mind, And that, that right there, is a battle for the ages. 
You—the you that you call yourself—exist in your conscious thought, but are governed substantially by what your subconscious perceives as pleasureful or painful. So, even if you think kratom is bad and say so out loud, your subconscious hasn’t gotten the memo. Recall, the communication path between the conscious and subconscious mind is unidirectional. The subconscious tells the conscious what to do, not the other way around. Since the subconscious is responsible for authoring your core beliefs, and has found definitively that kratom is something that both provides pleasure and avoids pain, it will always tell you as much. And it will tell you with increasing aggression the longer you consciously avoid listening to it. Worse, the subconscious has an infinite power supply and no off button. Your conscious only has the power of will. You can try to ignore your subconscious, but the subconscious is vehement in getting its way. It is designed to get you towards a place of pleasure and safety. That’s its job. It is unable to understand that even though you liked taking kratom in the beginning, you are now totally ashamed of yourself for taking it every day, and desperately wish you could stop. Shame and desperation are the realm of the conscious mind, not the subconscious. 
This returns us to the analogy of the tree of behavior. The roots are pursuit of pleasure and fear of pain, the trunk is core beliefs, and the branches are how you are motivated to carry out those beliefs. From an addiction standpoint, when the disconnect between the conscious and subconscious brain creates enough cognitive dissonance, your motivations around how, when, and why to take kratom are changing. Consciously, you are completely unmotivated to take kratom. Subconsciously, you remain as motivated as ever. So you start acting differently. 
Let’s say you normally buy kratom from a gas station on the way to work each morning. However, today, you are making a conscious effort to stay kratom-free. In order to prevent yourself from feeling tempted by the gas station, you take a different route to work. It takes longer, but it holds no association with kratom, so driving it causes far less mental discomfort than does driving by the gas station. Your motivation to avoid kratom changed the way you got to work. Your actions changed. 
Unfortunately, a few hours into your shift, you feel withdrawal symptoms set in. You are antsy and anxious. You can’t sit still. You feel unbearably sad. Your body looks like you may have the flu. You’re irritable. You can’t stand being around your coworkers. Now, your motivation isn’t to avoid kratom, it’s to avoid feeling withdrawal symptoms. But you only know one way to do it. and your subconscious is likely screaming at you—again, as it is programmed to do—to take the substance that it knows ill end the pain and bring you pleasure: kratom. It’s yelling at you so loud that it’s all you can think about. It is the ultimate craving. Here’s where the insidious mantras all addicts are familiar with start to come into the picture: “I can just take one more dose. Just one. Just to get through the day.” “I deserve a break from all this stress and anxiety.” “I can take more today and try to quit tomorrow when I feel stronger.” Of course, every addict who’s suffered these thoughts knows that none of them are helpful, nor valid, nor even honest. There’s no such thing as one more dose and there’s no such thing as quitting tomorrow. A dose of kratom is a dose of an addictive drug and tomorrow will bear no special advantage over today.  But when the subconscious isn’t able to motivate you to do what it wants with normal methods, it invents new ones. Now your motivation is one of seeking relief. That’s a particularly tricky motivation to consciously ignore. It’s not something that comes and goes, it’s omnipresent. When you’re suffering, you are 100% aware of the pain, 100% of the time. The only way out is through, and getting through means willingly forgoing the relief you know will comes as soon as you take the very thing you’ve been so diligent to avoid. More kratom. The whole affair is brutally insidious. The deck is stacked sky high against the conscious mind, and against you, who just wants to stop taking a drug that you know is ruining your life. You get angry, thinking, “Why can’t I just stop taking this?!” 
It’s because your subconscious still adheres to its core belief about kratom bringing you pleasure and avoiding pain. Until that core belief is altered, your conscious and subconscious brain will be in a daily, continual tug of war over your motivations, and thereby, your behavior, your actions. Living through this tug of war is agonizing. Just ask any addict. It’s sheer misery. It’s confusing, and no solution to the problem ever presents itself. To the addict, the cognitive dissonance of conscious versus subconscious mind is a veritable way of life, just as sleeping, eating, and breathing. It’s a never-ending mental suffering. 
This book is designed to alter that core belief that your subconscious mind long-ago authored about kratom. Because, while your subconscious mind won’t heed to your conscious thoughts, only vice versa, it will continue to interact with the world and take notes. By reading this book, you have exposed your subconscious to a new representation of kratom. A negative representation. And, crucially, everything in this book is true, and the subconscious mind fundamentally knows and responds to this. Every argument in this book is logical and appeals directly to the only two things the subconscious mind cares about: pleasure and pain. Remember, the subconscious doesn’t care how much money you’ve spent on kratom, nor about your failing health and worsening personal relationships—that is the realm of your conscious thought. Kratom exists independently of those things in the subconscious mind. Kratom exists as a tool, just like every other thing in the world, that either gives pleasure or creates pain. 
My job is to paint a new picture of kratom so clear, so vivid, and so logical, that the subconscious can’t help but change its beliefs. This is the only way we can rewrite your core beliefs. We must directly challenge the assumptions that your subconscious made when authoring your core belief around kratom. We take them on, one by one, and show that, actually, the information your subconscious had when it took its notes on kratom’s pleasure and pain capacities was woefully insufficient. In fact, the information you had was bad information. You had no idea that what you were really doing when you started taking kratom was entering into an addiction that you would later deeply regret and detest. 
Your subconscious initially perceived kratom as a way to alleviate stress-a magical elixir that made your mental anguish evaporate. It was only much later, and once you had developed a habit, that you consciously realized that kratom was actually contributing—significantly—to your stress and anxiety. Your subconscious initially perceived kratom as a way to manage pain naturally and effective. It was only later that your pain returned, possibly even worse than it was before, only now, only now, you’re stuck in a $50/day drug habit. Your subconscious mind initially perceived kratom as a way to get energy, motivation, and focus on demand. It was only later that your ability to remain focused and motivated on anything without taking kratom was severely impaired, and that your sleep was so poor that you never feel energized for the day. Every benefit that you thought kratom was providing, and which your subconscious took into account when authoring its core belief about kratom, turned into a burden. Every perceived value into a vice. You know, consciously, that kratom is destroying your life. Your subconscious, as you read this book and expose kratom’s benefits for burdens and values for vices, is taking new notes. And these new notes will supersede the old ones. While your conscious mind can’t speak to your subconscious, facts can, and they do. Your subconscious is always listening to the world around it, and therefore, the best way to sway your core belief about kratom is to blow up the false assumptions that were made about it in the early days of your use. That’s what this book is for, and that’s how we will solve the devilish disconnect between your conscious and subconscious mind. We will systematically expose false beliefs about kratom until your subconscious has no other option but to see it for what it is: an addictive drug that is ruining your life. Once that clicks, and your conscious and subconscious beliefs align, you will be as eager to stop taking kratom as you ever felt for anything in your life. And the best part is, your subconscious will no longer stand in your way. In fact, it will be the one most vociferously telling you to quit and never, ever take it again. 
That day is coming. It is the day you finish this book. I can’t wait for you to leave kratom behind forever. I can’t wait for you to take your life back under your own control again. I simply can’t wait for you to be free. Let’s do this. 
Dealing with doubt 
There is almost a 100% guarantee that at least some part of you doesn’t believe this book will cure your addiction. That is reasonable. It is expected. And it is nothing to worry about. You’ve probably tried to quit in the past. Or cut down your daily intake. Or go a day or two or three without using. And it didn’t work. And perhaps you’ve tried an array of these approaches. And they didn’t work. Maybe, you got clean for a week, a month, a year, multiple years, only to fall back into your old habits. What I am pointing out here is that even though you’re reading this book so that you can quit successfully this time, there is still a part of your mind that squirms indignantly, asking you, “If we couldn’t do this ourselves, how is this totally stranger going to do it for us? How can we possibly quit an addictive drug like kratom simply by reading a book?” These are perfectly valid questions. 
The reason this book works is, it doesn’t focus on your past attempts to quit or cut down, it focuses on exposing your kratom use for exactly what it is: a habit based on flawed information and false information about what a highly addictive drug would do to your life. The whole point of the book is to open your eyes to see past what you have come to believe about kratom. And I mean really believe. Deep down. In a place your conscious thoughts don’t go. Down in the core of your mind. In your subconscious, the place where your true motivations live. A place your conscious mind can’t access.  This book is designed to access your subconscious, explore the assumptions it has about kratom, expose them as false. Assumptions like: kratom relaxes me, kratom makes me more sociable, kratom reduces stress and anxiety in my life, kratom is the only thing that makes life worth living, if I don’t use kratom, I’ll go back to other addictive, life-ruining drugs like prescription pain killers or alcohol. Every single one of these assumptions is false and was formed in your subconscious mind due to bad information. We will discuss this bad information, and unpack exactly why the subconscious mind forces you to act out a habit you despise, in later chapters. For now, I want to address that voice in your head that may still be taking issue with the idea that a book can cure an addiction when you couldn’t. 
First of all, I need you to do me one overarching favor while you read this book: approach the concepts I discuss with curiosity, and not cynicism. This book is going to challenge you on a few core beliefs you hold. It will hold up some unpleasant truths to the light and ask you to explore them. I won’t ask you to accept these truths, but to explore them. to approach them with curiosity. Don’t write off the concepts in this book until you’ve finished the book itself. Be curious about them. I promise you, what I’m writing here exactly describe the approach I used to quit kratom, and when I quit, I absolutely never doubted my decision. By the third day clean, I had even forgotten I was actively quitting a highly addictive drug. I had almost no withdrawals to speak of. Instead of pain, I felt joy. Intense, life-enriching joy. And you will, too, provided that you remain curious and open to the concepts in this book. 
Cynicism to this book’s ideas will kill the effectiveness of the approach I introduce before it even has a chance to help you. That voice in your head that complains, “How can a book help me quit an addiction?” does so not from a place of gratitude, but from pain. It is nothing short of your ego trying to get attention. Trust me, I am not here to hurt your ego. In no way, shape, or form, will I ever diminish your previous attempts to quit or cut down. Even if you view those attempts as showcases of weakness or failure, I view them as nothing short of displays of bravery. Truly. The sheer courage it takes to stand up to your inner demons, your addiction, and fight for your freedom, is staggering. The battles that occur inside our minds are ravaging and exhausting. Losing to your “self” is demoralizing. Being unable to control your cravings, despite knowing you are destroying your life, can make you feel like you have nothing worth living for. Like your life is no longer your own. How could it be, if you continue to make decisions that you know are harming you and your loved ones? 
This way of thinking leads to cynicism. It blacks out the true bravery and courage you’ve already displayed by trying to stand up to and fight your addiction. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve tried to quit and failed. It simply doesn’t. 1 or 100 times, you still did it. you fought. And the fact that you are reading this book means that you are still fighting. There is no place for cynicism in that. There is only room for hope. Hope and curiosity. Hope that this will be the last time you “quit for the last time.” Read the pages in this book with hope, not cynicism, and you will be rewarded.
To drive this point home, let’s try a little thought experiment. I want you to think of someone you love. It could be your child, a parent, your spouse, your friend, whoever comes to mind first. Someone who truly means a lot to you. Who you feel a wellspring of love for, deep in your heart. Now, imagine you’re talking with someone over lunch and they ask you about this person. How difficult would it be to describe what you love in this person? Would you enjoy talking about what you love about this person, or makes excuses and caveats for how you feel? Would you take five minutes to come up with one thing you love about this person, or would you come up with five things in one moment? One second? How do you think you would feel describing this person? Good? Joyful? Excited? Or nervous, scared, apprehensive? 
I’m willing to bet that if someone asked you about someone you love deeply, you would describe them with an equal depth. You would enjoy the discussion. You would feel joy and excitement talking about what it is that makes them mean so much to you. I want you to imagine having this conversation. Really. Picture the whole thing. Picture how much satisfaction it gives you to talk about someone who means so much to you. 
Now imagine that the person you’re having lunch with asks you, “Okay, well, what do you love about yourself?” How does that question make you feel? Good? Joyful? Excited? Or nervous? Scared? Apprehensive? How many reasons can you come up with, and how quickly did you come up with them, to tell the person why you love yourself? Or do you feel more compelled to list reasons why you do not love yourself? Do you find it difficult to describe what you love about yourself? Maybe you came up with plenty of good reasons you love yourself, but you wish there were more. You clearly see the love-worthy in you, but you see perceived flaws just as clearly. Flaws that you don’t consider worthy of love. The conversation turns from one of satisfaction to one of discomfort.  
This experiment can be replicated physically. Go to a mirror in a quiet room and take 60 seconds to look at yourself in the eyes. 60 uninterrupted seconds. Look right in your own eyes. Don’t look at your body or the room you’re in, just focus on your eyes. Go try that right now. 
What did you feel? Excited and joyful, or nervous and scared? Or a mixture of all four? Or did you feel a plethora of emotions, some good, some bad? I’d be willing to bet your felt good emotions, bad emotions, and emotions in between. You saw things you loved, and you saw things you don’t. That’s fine. That’s a natural reaction. We all carry with us both positive and negative perceptions of ourselves—things we don’t want to change and things we wish we could change immediately. 
Here's the thing, that person whom you love do deeply, and who, in your imaginary lunchtime conversation, had so little trouble describing in loving terms, would  likely have the exact same reaction as you did. If that person was asked to list the reasons thy are worth loving, they would have a far more difficult time than you. If they looked themselves in the eye for 60 seconds, they would see far more negative things than you see. So, who among the two of you is right? Is your far more glowing and loving perception of them the right one, or is their more self-critical, negative perception correct?
Maybe you think it’s yours. The truth is, which perception is correct not only doesn’t matter, it’s impossible to know. What does matter is that you have no trouble seeing loveable qualities in that person. And, even though that person may see fewer loveable qualities than you (and likely an array of negative ones), you still deeply love this person. The person they are to you is one worth every ounce of the love you have for them. Their perception, with its negative qualities and all, doesn’t change how you feel about them. You love that person, pure and simple. And that is an extremely beautiful aspect of being a human being: we can see all the love inside someone even when that person cannot see it. 
And here’s the great news: there is someone is this world, whether your child, a parent, your spouse, or a friend, who loves you deeply, and who has no trouble listing the reasons they love you. In any imaginary lunch conversation, when someone asks, “Describe your love for this person?” they will have just as easy a time talking about what they love about you as you did about the person you love. Right now, literally right now, there is a person living in this world who loves you and has no trouble describing exactly why you are worth loving. That person may even be the same person you thought of for your own imaginary lunch conversation.
Why do I bring this up? What’s the point of this little experiment? Because you need to know, before ewe go any further, that just because you have become addicted to a drug that is forcing you to act in ways you hate, and keeping you shackled to a habit you desperately wish to break, you are still deeply loved. Even if you have trouble respecting yourself. Even if you are ashamed of what you see when you look yourself in the eyes. Even if you mentally punish yourself every daily, a hundred times a day, for taking kratom. Even if your own list of reasons why you are worth living seems to be lacking. You simply must know that you’re your perception of yourself is not the only one. There is someone (and probably far more than just one someone) out there who loves to talk about you. 
Maybe you don’t think this is true because at this point in your addiction, you’ve disappointed your loved ones to the point where they no longer trust you the way they used to. Doesn’t matter. Get them in a conversation about you—the you without kratom—and they will have absolutely zero problem talking about why you are worth loving. And you know what? They’ll be right. All their reasons will be right. Because you are worth loving. You have third party verification! If someone loves you, you are by definition worth loving. And no matter what your own self-perception, it doesn’t change the fact that you are worth loving. 
This is an important theme to bring up because all too often, those addicted to drugs can lose their sense of self in the addiction. They come to believe that they no longer are themselves. They wish they could be like they used to be. They think they’ve disappointed themselves and others to the point where they have fundamentally changed who they are. That they are their addiction. But this simply isn’t true. Addiction sits on top of us like an elephant, refusing to let us free, but it does not become us. The common visual of addiction as a set of chains holding us captive is incredibly useful here: you are trapped. The drug trap is real. Kratom has trapped you and is demanding that you remain trapped for as long as you can sustain your addiction without dying or going destitute. But the addiction is the chains, not you. You are, and will always be, a separate entity from your addiction. As soon as you are free of the chains, and the elephant is no longer on top of you, there you will be. Just as you were before kratom. Do you think this version of you—free from kratom—is any different from the you that was yearning to be free from you addiction? It isn’t. The newly-freed version of you is every bit as deserving of love and respect as the you before kratom. And I promise you, from the bottom of my heart, no one is rooting harder for your freedom than the people who love you. 
Let’s take this experiment a step further. Go back to the imaginary lunch discussion about the person you deeply love. Picture them in your mind’s eye. Picture yourself being around them. Choose a particularly pleasant memory you have of being with them. What are you both doing? What are you talking about? Put yourself clearly in the moment. See the it clearly. 
Now let me ask: in this memory, is this person high on kratom? If the answer is no, do you think you would’ve better enjoyed being around this person, in this particularly pleasant scenario, If they were high on kratom? Or do drugs have absolutely nothing to do with how good the memory is? 
If the person was high on kratom, then let me ask: in this memory you chose, where you’re both particularly enjoying each other’s company, was the enjoyment so notable because the person was high? Or was it because you both genuinely were enjoying being around each other?
It is easy to see in this experiment that the reason the memory was so pleasant wasn’t because a drug was involved. The memory is pleasant because we simply love being around people we love. Drugs have nothing to do with it. they are not a part of the equation. Even if kratom was present in the memory, it didn’t make the memory remarkable. Love did. 
The truth is, kratom has no power to create good memories. Think about it, have you ever seen someone be at their best while constantly getting high on kratom? Did you love them more because of the way they acted while they were high? Or was it the opposite? Let’s say someone comes over to your home for a visit, do you hope they get high on kratom before knocking on your door? When you pick up the phone to talk to your kids or your parents, do you hope they’ve been taking kratom that day? Because, if they did, they’d be at their best? They’d make for a better visit, or a better phone call? That the best way to create a good memory with them would be if they were high first? No. of course not. because you don’t love them for who they are when they’re high, you love them for who they are before they got high, and in spite of them getting high. You know that they absolutely, in no way shape or form, need kratom to be at their best. Right?
Well, the good news is, that’s exactly how your loved ones feel about you. All the time you’ve spent convincing yourself that you’re well-spoken, sociable, funny, and otherwise loveable while being high on kratom, you’re simply convincing yourself of things your loved ones already knew about you. Things they knew long before you took kratom. Kratom doesn’t make anyone “better” at anything. It can’t. It’s a plant. Plants don’t have wide vocabularies, quick wits, or good jokes. You do. That’s right: you already have all the things people love about you. It’s already there! This is excellent news. Kratom has and had nothing to do with the things about you worth loving. Nothing at all. You already have everything there inside of you. And remember, even if you can’t see many things worth loving right now, I have already proved to you that you are worth loving, simply by virtue of the fact that someone loves you right now! It doesn’t matter what kratom is making you think about yourself. Right now, someone loves you deeply, and if, over lunch, was asked to describe what it is they love about you, they’d have no trouble coming up with a laundry list of reasons. Talking about what they love about you would bring them satisfaction, they same it would for you to talk about someone you love. 
Freeing yourself from kratom doesn’t make you less fun, less sociable, less well-spoken. It means coming back to all the things that people who love you already loved about you. Quitting kratom means returning to the person everyone already loves, because that person never left the world. You have been you, the whole time, all through your addiction. Once you are free, you will see so clearly, all the best parts of yourself will rise to the surface, all the parts that people love about you. On full display. You will feel their love more brightly than you have since the addiction took hold of you. You never needed kratom, nor any drugs, to make that love better. It already is better. Love is as good as anything can be. When you’re free, you won’t need a drug to feel like a better version of yourself. You already be a better version of yourself! And unlike kratom, you won’t have to pay a single dime for it. 
So if you still have doubts, that’s fine. It’s expected. All I ask is that you allow yourself to hear the ideas in this book and reserve judgement on them until the end. And if you find that the book has done nothing for you, though I will be saddened to hear it, I’ll refund the money you spent. 
What is an addict?
I’ll say this up front: personally, I hate the term addict. I think it conjures up images of dirty, poorly mannered, gruff individuals who care only about their drug of choice. Everything about the term “addict” suggests some form of tragedy. And so when we call a human being an addict, we impart upon them all of the negative connotations I just described, and possibly more. “Addict” seem smore of an insult than a descriptor. No one wants to be an addict, for obvious reasons, but similarly, no one wants to be called an addict. It’s a dreadful title. Again, it suggests tragedy in every respect. Addicts don’t have nice homes, happy families, good jobs, financial fortune, clean clothes, nice manners, etc., etc. 
Except nothing could be further from the truth, as you almost certainly know, if you consider yourself an addict. The term addict derives from the biological condition of being addicted to a chemical substance, a state that has very clear criteria. The United States National Institutes of Health refers to addiction as, “Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences. It is considered a brain disorder, because it involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control. Those changes may last a long time after a person has stopped taking drugs.” Notice, there is no mention of the quality of someone’s home, family, job, money, clothing, or manners. The NIH is clear that addiction is compulsive drug seeking behavior driven by functional changes to the brain. That’s it. Addiction is the self-destructive cycle of behavior driven by changes made to the brain by an addictive drug. Nowhere in that definition does the NIH qualify that in order to be considered a true “addict,” your life must be visibly falling apart. An addict is someone who is driven to actions the he or she would rather not pursue, due to a chemical imbalance in the brain, primarily in the neurocircuitry related to reward, stress, and self-control.
When put that way, it is far easier to contextualize just why you—who are most likely not a jobless, homeless, individual—may qualify as an addict. But it should also help make it clear that you have simply reacted to the presence of an addictive drug in a way that human beings react to addictive drugs. Addictive drugs are addictive because they ignite the reward systems in the brain. They create seemingly magical pathways that release pleasing sensations normally reserved for situations of true pleasure. For example, there is nothing positively euphoric about sitting on the couch every day and watching television. In fact, doing that every day is likely to make you feel lazy, depressed, and unmotivated. But when you pair watching television every day from your couch with an addictive drug like kratom, which possesses a pharmaceutical profile similar to opium and plays on the same opioid receptors as morphine and morphine derivatives—it can feel simply incredible. And when you have a shortcut to inducing sheer euphoria by just sitting around doing nothing, you are fundamentally changing the way the brain works. 
The brain has evolved to reward you for doing things that bring the body pleasure and remove pain. Typically, activities that bring pleasure involve exactly that—activities. Forming new friendships and enjoying old ones. Having sex and falling in love. Chasing after food and catching it, cooking it, and eating it. Showing leadership in your group. Exercising. Building a home or fixing a vehicle. The list is truly endless. But every single item on the list involves either facilitating a social bond or your own personal accomplishment. Absolutely nothing about sitting around on a couch and watching television facilitates bonds or achievements. It is almost the bare minimum of human existence. I should know, my go-to while high on kratom was to sit on the couch and watch television or play video games.  There is no circumstance where the brain induces a state of intense euphoria from doing the bare minimum of human existence. In fact, it punishes you for it, as mentioned, by inducing feelings of laziness, depression, and a lack of motivation. 
But being active in life can be hard. Forming societal bonds, or actively deepening bonds you already have, can be taxing. Setting up and achieving your personal goals is daunting and challenging. Fatigue for engaging in those activities sets in, and sometimes quickly. As a result, you may find yourself sitting on the couch, watching television, wishing you had “what it took” to be more sociable or motivated. You probably imagine other people you know, who you perceive to be better equipped for social scenarios, or who take proactive stances at work, or who always seem like they are coming from the gym, and think that you just aren’t like them. You’re different. You don’t have what it takes to go after all that activity—not without something to help you along the way. 
This mindset is a breeding ground for addiction. As soon as you feel like you wish you “had what it takes” to do all the things in life that you imagine would make you happy, and which you imagine are making other people happy, you subconsciously start hunting for alternatives. Something that you can take to make it all less intimidating. To make you more sociable, or a better, harder worker, or which allows you to focus on your personal goals. And wouldn’t it be particularly great if that something could come in a pill form? Or a little shot? A vial? A tea? A powder? And wouldn’t it be even better if you could buy as much as you want of it? And from the nearest gas station, of all places?
Enter kratom. From your first dose, kratom made you believe that all of those things you wish you were better at are now things you are better at. Your worries, insecurities, motivation, confidence—all are improved. With one pill. One drink. 
If it seems too good to be true, well, that’s because it is. Sure, kratom may make you feel like you’re better at all those things, but that’s just an illusion. In reality, kratom increases your worries, magnifies your insecurities, saps your motivation, and destroys your confidence. But you have no way of knowing that, not in the beginning. Because in the beginning, kratom is opening up rewards pathways in the brain you didn’t know were there. You felt states of euphoria so intense that the only natural high that can come close to it is orgasmic sex (not something you can typically get at a gas station).  Kratom feels like a cheat code. Like a free pass to feel all of the best things in life you normally only feel after engaging in activities that may fatigue you. Or activities that make you overcome your perceived worries, insecurities, lack of motivation, or low self-confidence. That’s right, the body actually induces states of euphoria (much milder than kratom highs) when you are your own agent behind your self-improvement. If you want to get high, just work on improving any of your worries, insecurities, motivations, and confidence. It works. It works every time. And there will never be any withdrawals. 
So what happens when you start taking kratom, other than allowing the drug to fool you into thinking you’re a better version of yourself? Kratom’s psychoactive ingredient, mitragynine, and its less abundant, but far more potent cousin, 7-hydroxymitragynine, binds to and activates the mu-opioid receptors in the nervous system. Though the body has three classes of opioid receptors (mu, kappa, and gamma), the mu class is the only one associated with feelings of intense euphoria. From an evolutionary standpoint, the potential to induce euphoria served as an adaptative mechanism to subconsciously reward a human being for engaging in an activity that the brain considers as pleasureful. This could be sex, eating a delicious food, laughing with friends, hearing a great story…the list goes on. Pleasureful can serve also as an analogue to beneficial. Take exercise, for example, though exercise can be painful, the brain knows that exercise is good for the body, and thus releases endorphins (the body’s all-natural pain killing neurotransmitters) during and after a workout to bind with the mu-opioid receptors in your brain and spine. It causes you to feel a mild euphoria. The brain is subconsciously rewarding you for engaging in beneficial activities. 
Such is the way euphoria is meant to be controlled and experienced in the human body. As a reward for a meaningfully pleasureful or beneficial activity.  Not, as previously mentioned, for sitting on a couch, staring at a screen, every day. But kratom reengineers the brain’s reward pathways to do just that: reward you for doing nothing. With prolonged use, kratom literally physically rewires the neuronic connections in your brain to reward you for using kratom. Like a virus implanting itself in a cell and taking over its functions. As you continue to take kratom and derive unnatural, and crucially, undeserved, euphoria from the most mundane of daily activities, the brain begins to associate those daily activities with the euphoria kratom induces. However, the only way to achieve that euphoria is to take kratom. You can’t suddenly stop taking kratom and remain in a blissful euphoric high while sitting around, doing nothing. In fact, if you tried to do that, you’d probably see fairly quickly just how useless sitting around everyday really is (again, speaking from vast personal experience). 
This means that you’ve a trap for yourself. You’ve rewired your internal systems to associate non-rewarding activities with rewards. Of course, the activities haven’t somehow changed to become naturally rewarding. They will never be naturally rewarding. But the activities you can engage in that are naturally rewarding might bring you fatigue, or weigh upon your worries, insecurities, motivation level, or self-confidence. So, faced with the prospect of engaging in naturally rewarding activities or taking a kratom pill, shot, tea, or powder to feel rewarded, the brain begins to suggest taking the kratom. Then, it demands kratom. Then, you find that you are no longer able to engage in mundane activities without the drug you’ve associated with them. It seems almost painful to sit around and watch television without being high—or at least having some kratom in the next room to grab if you want some. Kratom has infected its way into your daily life and told you that in order to feel pleasure, you don’t have to do anything remotely pleasureful…other than taking kratom. 
At this point, you may start taking more and more of it. You may start taking it with things that you don’t even need it for, like playing with your kids, hanging out with friends, or playing music—all activities that naturally bring pleasure. And you may start taking it more and more to pass time during the mundane or boring parts of your life, like sitting in traffic, being at work, or making dinner. And you may even have started taking it to cope with the negative parts of your life, such as abusive relationships, feelings of loneliness, general depression, or chronic anxiety. At every turn, your injection of kratom into these scenarios turns them from their natural state into an altered one. One that becomes steadily associated with pleasure. Playing with your kids? Jazz it up with a pill. Hate your job? Ease the dreariness with a shot. Feeling isolated? Make it go away with some powder. 
But the kratom pill, shot, and powder will do absolutely nothing to actually make playing with your kids more fun, or make your job inherently less boring, or solve your feeling of loneliness. All kratom will do is get you high. And each time it gets you high, it will hijack more and more control from your brain. Those new reward pathways that match non-rewarding activities with expectations of euphoria get more and more deeply etched into the physical tissue of your brain (yes, really). And soon, you’re taking kratom throughout the day, regardless of activity. 
This is how addiction develops. Not by stealing your home, your family, your job, your money, and your manners. But by stealing your control. When you’re taking a drug every day, throughout the day, no matter what your plans are, that drug has installed a lever in your neurocircuitry that, when pulled, will make you do whatever it is you have to do to get kratom and take it. And each time you come down from a high, that lever gets pulled. The lever is pulled, the reward pathway is activated, and you feel driven, subconsciously to drive to a shop and buy more kratom. Or to reach in your backpack, purse, dresser, desk, glovebox, or pocket and take a dose. Read the definition of addiction from the NIH again: “Addiction is defined as a chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite adverse consequences. It is considered a brain disorder, because it involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control.”
Notice the last words in the definition: self-control. Once you are addicted to it, kratom rewards you for taking it, stresses you out when you try to stop taking it, and takes removes your self-control in the process. Only after we lose control to the drug do things like homelessness, divorce and custody battles, being fired from work, draining bank accounts, and becoming irritable or distant in our behavior start to manifest. Before any of those things can occur, we become addicted. 
That’s why I hate the term addict. “Addict” is not the sum of all terrible things that occur to someone under. The control of an addictive drug. “Addict” is state of being trapped. An addict was lured into a cage by an addictive drug, and that drug will do whatever it can to convince the addict to stay there. That’s what an addict is: someone who had absolutely no intention of ending up where they are. Someone who didn’t know they were stepping into a trap. Someone who didn’t even know they were trapped until it was too late. Someone who desperately wishes that they had control over their actions. Someone who wishes they didn’t take the drug that trapped them and controls them. An addict is someone who wants to be free. 
You will be free. Even though kratom trapped you, you will be free. How do I know? Because as powerful as addictive drugs are, they pale in comparison to the power of the human mind. There is simply nothing on earth as powerful as the mind. This book is designed exclusively to help you hardness and direct the awesome power of your mind—power that is already there—to set you free from the trap. No trap can hold the mind hostage. It’s utterly impossible. The mind can break free from any tethers placed upon it. This is a fact. When a mind desires something—truly desires it—no drug can stop it from attaining what it wants. And if you truly desire to be free from kratom, when you no longer see it as useful to you in any way, and instead see it as nothing more than an impediment to your better self, you will step out of the trap and back into the world as a free person. And you will never look back. 
I don’t take it because I am addicted, I take it because I like it
I remember New Year’s Eve, 2023, my girlfriend and I drove out to a friend’s apartment to join a little party. Just a small get together. I hadn’t had anything alcoholic to drink in 7 months at that point, and I knew there would be drinking at the party. At this point in my kratom addiction, I was in what you might call the shallow end of the pool. I took Feel Free semi-regularly, but hadn’t come to rely on it for everyday functioning. I was still at my “take it or leave it…but probably take it” phase. On the way to the party, I stopped at a corner store—the store that introduced me to Feel Free in the first place—and picked dup three bottles. That way, while others were drinking alcohol, I could abstain. I would have my own party favor. No booze, no problem. I would take half a vial of Feel Free while others took a shot of vodka, tequila, or whisky. And I wouldn’t feel like I was missing out. Note, at this point in my drinking abstinence, I never felt like I was missing out on anything. I found alcohol as appealing as dirt. But after a few months taking Feel Free, the part of my brain that got excited by being able to drink something that would create a pleasureful effect was consistently active. Did I need Feel Free to enjoy the party? No. But did I think it would make the party better? Definitely. 
So we show up at the party with a bottle of wine for the hosts, and me with three little blue vials in my jacket pocket. It doesn’t take long for the proposal of a toast. Everyone grabs a glass of champagne. I pull out a vial. Immediately, I’m asked what it is. I tell them it’s a kava drink (which I actually thought it was). I tell them its some kind of health-conscious little drink that makes you feel good. I didn’t think anything of saying this, other than the fact that I felt a bit stupid touting the benefits of what felt life “new age” medicine as an alternative to booze—the proper toasting beverage. My friends nodded in approval, but had no interest in trying it. We all cheersed our glasses, made New Year’s proclamations, and drank. 
I’ll never forget just how disgusting Feel Free tastes. But then again, the first few times we drink hard liquor, we have similar reactions: the stomach jumps to attention, the gag reflex kicks in, and we feel extremely aware of the liquid slipping down our throat and coating our gut. Feel Free was always like this. Just putrid stuff. But, like hard liquor, I knew that the effects of the beverage would soon replace the sick feeling of drinking it. 
Half an hour later, my friends has poured a few more drinks, and I was starting to feel the euphoria I was waiting for. The warmth of it rushed over me, and I thought, “If this is what I can do instead of drinking, I am a lucky man for having found it. Where has kava been my whole life?” The party continued. Laughter, conversations about nothing in particular. I felt warm. Comfortable. Affable. Until, slowly, the euphoria wore off, and I started to come down from my kratom-induced high. And my brain started to tell me to pull out the vial and finish the other half. Becoming sober after being high always had this effect on me. Like I saw the beginning of a good movie or read the start of a good book, only to have the screen turned off or pages ripped out. 
Here's a primary difference between drinking alcohol and drinking kratom. People on their way to becoming drunk don’t allow themselves intervals of sobering up. Getting drunk is a continual upward climb. It is not pockmarked by valleys of sobriety. If it were, you can bet that alcohol drinkers would have the same reaction as I did towards Feel Free. They would prefer not to sober up. They would take another shot. And sure, you could take this approach to drinking alcohol, but imagine a party where everyone takes a shot of vodka, waits for it to wear off, takes another shot, waits for it to wear off, and repeats the process until it’s time to go home. Doesn’t make any sense, right? Instead, drinking is about reaching a state of inebriation and either maintaining it or increasing it (normally, it’s the latter). 
Drinking kratom in similar fashion is not possible. Kratom’s active ingredient, mitragynine, is a partial mu-opioid agonist. This means that though absorbing it into the body will produce euphoric similar to an opiate like morphine,  you cannot get “higher and higher” with more and more mitragynine in your system. There is a chemical cut off point at which taking more mitragynine won’t increase your sense of euphoria. Instead, it will be processed an expelled from your system. 
Notably, alcohol is not like this. A person can drink until drunk, and then continue to drink and drink, increasing the level of inebriation with each dose of alcohol. If the person drinks enough, he or she will pass out from over intoxication. If the person drinks too much, that person will die from alcohol poisoning. Morphine can create the same effect: taking more and more morphine (or heroin, fentanyl, hydrocodone, and oxycontin) increases the high the user experiences. If the user takes enough, he or she will fall asleep. If the user takes too much, the user’s respiratory system loses the ability to expel breath quickly enough to prevent carbon dioxide buildup in the blood, and the user will die. 
This may be the only benefit from taking high doses of mitragynine: you can only get so high from it. However, that does mean that you must wait until your body has processed it, removed it from your opioid receptors, and you sober up, until you can get high again. Such was the case at the New Year’s party. I sobered up from my first kratom dose, and immediately wanted more. If my friends were getting drunk, I didn’t want to feel high and then get sober and stop there. In fact, that’s why I bought three bottles. That’s why I only took ½ the vial in my first dose. I knew what was coming. I knew I would feel high, and then come down. So I finished the rest of the vial. 
Twenty minute later, the sense of euphoria started creeping back in. Just as planned. If I could get high for a while, then sober up, and get high again, there was really no harm done. I wasn’t getting drunk. I wasn’t drinking ethanol—a known carcinogen. And best of all, no matter how much Feel Free I had, I would be able to drive home later. What a gift. 
Except this second sensation of euphoria didn’t hit as hard as the first nor last as long. Of course, I knew this was likely going to be the case as well. It wasn’t my first time drinking multiple bottles in one night. I knew that if I drank ½ a vial to start, the second ½ wouldn’t be as potent. “Oh well,” I thought, “Might as well top off with the second vial.” I drank half of the second vial. I now had 1½ doses of Feel Free in my body. And while my friends continued talking and laughing and drinking, I got high again. Just as planned. 
Only, there’s a very unfortunate side effect of having too much kratom in your system. It makes you sick. Not necessarily vomit sick, but sickly. Feel Free especially. Having too much of that sludge in my body made my stomach feel bloated and cramped, like it was carrying something it was allergic to and quickly wanted to release to the next digestive organ. Then, in addition to the euphoric high, a general and light brain fog set in, slowing my thoughts. Let me tell you, to be in a room of happy drunk friends while you are simultaneously feeling euphoria, a sense of sick, and mental fog is a confusing state of being. You don’t know whether to be worried that you’re taking too much, or to try not to focus on your queasiness and instead try to lean into the high, despite the mental fog, and focus on getting your money’s worth of kratom. 
Well, the second high came and went, just as quickly as the first. Only now I had just half the supply of Feel Free that I arrived with. And I knew that drinking more of it would only increase my feeling of being sick, and the mental fog. There’s a point of taking kratom where you turn from being in a euphoric state to being in a groggy, mental mist. Two Feel Free vials in two hours would always take me there. But I was sobering up, and the party was moving from sitting around the living room to playing games somewhere. I let everyone pass me by on their way out of the room. Then, I took out my third vial of Feel Free and downed the whole thing. Screw it, I thought, this should get me high enough to forget all the sickliness and brain fog. I caught up to everyone and we started playing party games. That’s three vials in just over 2 hours. 
So what happened? I got high, sure, but my stomach absolutely was upset with me. It started cramping violently. I couldn’t ignore it. I did my best not to let anyone see my discomfort. Did they notice? I’ll never know. But was I able to focus on the party games and join in the fun? Not really. I was too uncomfortable. And as the high wore off, only twenty minutes after it started, I was left feeling truly rough. Like a bad hangover kind of rough. My thoughts blurred inside my mind. My gag reflex started to tease me. I went to the bathroom and considered vomiting. I looked at my reflection. My eyes were semi-bloodshot and yellowed. My skin was pale. Characteristic purple bags were forming under my eyes. I looked like someone who was either sick or recovering from being sick. I felt startled and nervous. Would they comment on my appearance? Would someone ask me if I was alright? What would I say? “Just feeling a little off is all.” “No no, don’t worry about me. I don’t know why I look like this, everything is fine.” In other words, if they asked me—if my friends asked me—if I was okay, I was going to lie to them. 
And so what did I do? Vomit any remaining Feel Free out of my stomach? Wash my face. Throw the rest of the last vial away? Splash water in my eyes? No. And yes. No, I did not vomit, even though I desperately wanted (and needed) to. Yes, I washed my face, trying to return some blood to the skin so I didn’t look so ghoulish. No, I didn’t throw my final vial of Feel Free away—I drank what was left. Of course I did. In my own insane way, I thought it might get me high again, and hey, I couldn’t look any worse. Yes, I splashed water in my eyes, trying to cool them down and remove the bloodshot. Meanwhile, my friends were in the next room, playing and having fun. 
Before going back outside, I looked at my appearance again. I hadn’t improved at all. I still looked terrible. Only now, I was out of kratom. I would soon be fully sober, yet saddled with a headache, brain fog, brutally upset stomach, and the desire to just go home and sleep it off. These are all the exact symptoms of drinking too much that I had chosen to leave behind me when I quit drinking. My whole, “It’s a healthy alternative to alcohol that still makes you feel good,” argument was dead. I mean, even though I didn’t drink, I still knew that at the moment, my drunk friends were at least having fun in the next room! At least they weren’t getting their hangovers delivered to them in real time. I didn’t envy them, but I did envy the fact that they were out enjoying themselves, while I was in a state of self-induced suffering. Looking at myself in the mirror, all I could think was, “Why did you do this?”
This is why it’s impossible to like doing kratom. Because, just like any other addictive drug, as soon as you stop feeling high, you feel low. And as soon as you start to take increasing amounts of it, your body starts to become sick. Make no mistake, too much kratom will make you sick. You probably already know this. You’ve probably reached the point in your kratom intake where you felt dizzy, or got blurred vision, or started losing hair, or lost weight, or vomited, or became constipated, felt nauseous, and had a thick, heavy mental fog set in. You don’t feel this when you start taking kratom. Your first dose isn’t going to give you vertigo or see double. But first doses have a nasty habit of turning into second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth doses. 
It's impossible to like doing something that destroys your health. The natural reaction to something that makes you want to vomit is to avoid it. The natural reaction to drinking something that makes your appearance ghoulish and sick is to never drink it again. The natural reaction to taking something that makes you think more slowly is to replace it with something that increases your thinking capacity. 
Think about it: if you removed the euphoria you experience from kratom, would you even take it? Would you even give it a second thought? No. You would immediately stop taking it. And you’d probably pause to take a look at the sheer amount of money you’d been spending on your daily supply. You’d get to take a good, hard look at all the things you’d been sacrificing to maintain that supply, things like your relationships with family and friends, your bodily and mental health, your self-respect and sense of worth, your independent control over your decisions, and more. If you were to remove the way mitragynine interacts with the mu-opioid receptors in your nervous system, you would stop taking it immediately. And you’d see the drug for what it is: an overpriced, predatory product created by manufacturers who’d rather see you trade your money for your dignity than admit that they are selling you an addictive drug. 
You’d probably feel a sense of righteous anger. You’d look at the label, read the company name and address, and go online and heap negative reviews on their name. You’d probably look yourself in the mirror and feel like you were waking up. All that time you spent taking kratom…it wasn’t because it was some wellness alternative to alcohol. It wasn’t because it came in this or that flavor, or because one brand was more naturally sourced than another one. It wasn’t because the pills were more convenient than the powder. Wasn’t because kratom seemed like a healthier alternative to energy drinks, or made you feel stronger during your workouts. It didn’t make your job better. It didn’t make your kids more fun to play with. It didn’t make anything about you better. No. The reason you took so much of it was because it got you high.  
Maybe you’re at a point in your kratom intake where you’re only taking it a few times a day, and you’ve never felt the negative benefits I described. Maybe you’re reading this and feel like you can’t relate. If this is the case, I certainly understand, but I need you to reread the story I told about my New Year’s party. I felt at that time that Feel Free was something I could do without. Not something I needed. It was something I could take or leave. However, I did like taking it. I didn’t need to take it to function throughout the day. I wasn’t yet an addict. I didn’t need it, but I wanted it. The same way that you no doubt feel like you don’t need it, but want it. You choose to add it to your daily life, you don’t have to have it. Not like the addicts who are losing their families, money, and health. 
If you feel this way, I challenge you to do one thing: stop taking it. Now. Not tomorrow. Now. If you don’t need it, but want it, then you’re not addicted, right? And that means you can stop taking it at any time. Well, now is that time. I challenge you, stop taking it right now. I challenge you to stop. Stop for two weeks. Just throw all the kratom products you have in a box, lock the box, and move on with your day. Or better yet, since you don’t need it, don’t bother locking it up. Leave everything where it is. You’ll have it again in two weeks. Stop taking kratom now.
If you think I’m being unfair, let me tell you about something I don’t need, but I want. Steak. I don’t mean to offend vegetarians or vegans, but my favorite food in the whole world is steak. A giant, bone-in ribeye steak. Covered in garlic butter, cooked rare over open flame, and well-salted. It is the most mouthwatering food I have ever encountered, and to be completely honest, even writing this has made me hungry and gotten me salivating. I want it. And right now, I’ve gotten myself thinking about it to the point where I want it badly. 
But will I go out to a steakhouse? No. I want to, but I won’t. First of all, I’m busy writing this book and don’t want to cut my time short here. Second, a giant, bone-in ribeye with garlic butter and sea salt grilled over an open flame is not cheap. I know that (all too well). So, I won’t go buy one. Instead, I’ll probably have chicken that I make on my oven. No where near the same thing. I know. Sad. 
Then again, is it sad? Do I actually feel sad? No. I don’t. in fact, I know that as soon as I stop writing about a ribeye steak, I’ll forget about it. I’ll go throughout the rest of my whole day without thinking about it. Make no mistake, right now, I want it, but…do I need it? No. And no part of my brain is going to urge me throughout the day to go to a steakhouse. There isn’t some missing piece to my daily life that would be filled by steak. 
To the point, I regularly go two weeks without eating steak. I go two months without eating steak. That’s right, I go for months at a time before eating my favorite food in the whole world. But does that cause me mental anguish? No. I’m fine. I want steak, but I don’t need it. So when the opportunity to have on presents itself, of course I take it. But in the absence of this opportunity, I waste no mental energy on it. I want it, but I don’t need it. 
So, if you consider yourself separate from the addicts that you know are destroying their lives with kratom, I challenge you to treat kratom like I treat steak: as something that is truly a nice to have, but not a need to have. If you can take or leave kratom, leave it. And if my challenge seems somehow cruel or pushy, then don’t do it for me, do it for you. Just to prove to yourself that you’re right: you don’t actually need it. If you can go two weeks without feeling like you are missing out on some pleasure, then you can close this book and throw it in the trash—you truly are not addicted, and you don’t need any help. If, however, you have moments of doubt, where you start thinking, apropos of seemingly nothing, “Go get some kratom,” you will have failed. I never think, “Go get some steak.” I never drive by a steakhouse and have slight heart palpitations. Blood doesn’t rush to the head. If you’re able to drive past the shop where you normally buy kratom and feel absolutely nothing, this book isn’t for you. If, however, you feel an inexplicable draw to go inside, and a voice creeps into your conscious that suggests, “Go buy some kratom,” then this book is for you. If that voice enters your head at any time, you need to be wary. If that voice enters your head multiple times throughout the two weeks, be even more on your guard. If it speaks to you every day, especially around the times you normally take kratom, and if it gets more and more persistent, sounding louder and more forceful, then you are, I’m sorry to report, no different than the rest of us. The good news is, you’re now realizing that kratom has taken root (pun not intended) in your subconscious and is surreptitiously planting the seeds of addiction. Do not wait until that voice gets noisier, or visits you more often, or starts convincing you that you should get more kratom for parts of your daily routine you never thought needed it. 
The truth is that kratom is an addictive drug. That’s the long sand the short of it. Whether you feel fully in control of your intake or have long ago lost this control, you are on the same trajectory as any user of an addictive drug. Addiction is a one-way path towards mental slavery. Addictive drugs create addictions. You, no matter how strong you may be, are not immune from this rule. Now is the time to step off this path. Make no mistake about it, whatever you are thinking in terms of, “I can stop any time I want to…” I promise you—the rest of us at one point said the exact, same, thing. That’s how addiction works, it lets you feel like you're in control until suddenly, in one life-altering moment, you realize that you’re not. And that moment is sheer terror. The defining trait of being human is the ability to exercise free will. But free will only exists when the mind is in control of itself, and not when it is being influenced by a third party. All the worse if that third party is a drug. That drug will literally change the physical makeup of the mind to bend that human to its will. Doesn’t matter if you are draining your bank account to maintain your habit or only take doses infrequently during the week. It is all just different points on the same path of addiction. 
It is impossible to like taking a substance that leads to ruin. Deep down, at least some part of you knows this is true. And if you are inclined to disagree, I’ll repeat my challenge: stop taking kratom now—not tomorrow—now. And stay off of it for two weeks. See if you don’t hear that devilish voice of suggestion urging you to use, or to buy, and which becomes louder and more unruly the longer you refuse. That voice is the same voice any run-of-the-mill addict of any addictive drug hears. It is no different. It is the same. Feeding the urges that this voice pushes at you isn’t something you like doing. It simply can’t be. No one actually likes taking kratom. They take it because a voice in their mind tells them to take it. And when they stop taking it, that voice becomes angry, loud, persistent, punishing. It is simply impossible to like feeding a voice that treats you that way. Better to step off the addiction pathway, to see kratom for what it really is, and slice out the vocal cords of that voice. Kratom is an addictive drug. That voice is the voice of addiction. It does you no favors, and you do not enjoy keeping it alive. In fact, you will so much more enjoy quieting it for good by stepping out of your addiction. All that it takes to do so is to accept that kratom has lied to you, as all addictive drugs do. You don’t take it because you like it, you take it because it wants you to take it. 
The sooner you accept this as fact, the sooner control of your life will return to you. Human minds absolutely abhor letting anything control them. Freedom is the most important quality to human life. Since addictive drugs create mental slavery, when you fully accept that kratom is nothing more than an addictive drug that ants nothing more than to submit you to its control, you will remove it from your life. You will no sooner take kratom than slice off your hand. You will get rid of that voice urging you to submit to its demands as soon as you accept it for what it is: the enemy. A slave-master. A jailor. With no regard for your health or happiness. 
A path to addiction to an enemy, paved by mental slavery and imprisonment, or an immediate, joyful, and life-affirming return to freedom. I bet you know exactly which choice you will like taking. 
On Willpower
A few years ago, on a Friday morning, I woke up with one of the most powerful hangovers I’ve ever experienced. The previous night, I had drunk a pint of vodka and not one, but two bottles of wine. That’s the equivalent of entire bottle of hard liquor. There was no special occasion for drinking so much. In fact, the Thursday night preceding my hangover was simply that—a Thursday night. And, I specifically remember, when I started drinking, I wasn’t remotely motivated to get drunk. I only wanted to take a night to relax and play a new video game I was really enjoying. 
So, I started the game, sipping the vodka during pauses in the action. No ice, from the pint bottle. Small sips. Enough to keep from getting inebriated, I thought. Just to slowly inch my way toward a pleasant buzz. I recall, at first, how much sipping on vodka repelled my stomach. Each sip was like a welt that burgeoned and lessened in my gut, a birth and extinguishing of a fire. I didn’t like it. not that this was a new sensation to me. Of course it wasn’t. I just didn’t feel motivated to drink. I did because, well, I had spent many nights in my life watching TV or playing video games and drinking. It was the only way I could do such activities without feeling guilty that I was wasting my time, and more truthfully, wasting my life. But more on that later. 
I drank that night because it’s what I was used to doing when playing video games. Sip by sip, the time passed, until about an hour later, I was feeling a slight a pleasant buzz. The time was roughly 9:00 pm. The game was good, but I wanted it to be better. I switched from sips of the bottle to a shot glass. Anytime in the game that I died, or when there was a sufficiently long interval between drinks, I poured a shot and drank. The buzz morphed into a light drunkenness. Around 10:30 pm, I lost interest in the game and switched to TV. Actually, I switched to a movie called Donnie Darko, which I hadn’t seen since I was a teenager, and remember liking immensely. As the movie started, I poured a shot and drank. As the movie’s intrigue deepened, I drank another shot. And so on. About halfway through the movie, rougly11:15 pm, I ran out of vodka. At this point I was drunk, but unwilling to stop watching the movie and go to bed. However, if I kept watching, I’d sober up. After a pint of vodka, sobering up while conscious seemed like an incredibly stupid idea. So I opened a bottle of wine I found in the fridge and continued the movie.
Again, I drank from the bottle. No need to get a glass. Besides, I knew from experience that if I drank from the bottle, I would take far smaller sips than if I poured a glass. And I was already drunk, I didn’t want to get drunker (yes, I know how that sounds). I drank wine the same way I took shots: during points of intrigue, during lulls in action, which is essentially the cadence of any good movie. Build tension, release it. Drink wine, drink wine. When the movie ended, close to midnight, the wine was almost gone. 
By this time, I was drunk. And feeling sick. I had drank too much. I thought about going to bed and sleeping it off. But my stomach, which from the get-go had been quite vocal about its discomfort in my drinking, was shifting about and making me nauseous. I realized, with some shame, that I’d soon throw up. Not because I had to, but because it would get my stomach to calm down. I felt shame because it was at this point, midnight, on a Thursday, that I truly realized I had put myself in a position of being sick for no reason other than wanting to sit on a couch and look at a screen. Perhaps that was indicative of a far larger sickness within me, but again, more on that later. All that mattered was that I wasn’t ready to go to bed, but couldn’t stay up with the upset stomach. I said out loud, “Fuck it,” and headed to the bathroom. I promptly knelt in front of the toilet and shoved my fingers down my throat. 
Forcing yourself to vomit is a paradox in emotion. On one hand, by the time you’re done—assuming you were emptying yourself of too much booze—you feel great. You immediately feel lighter and healthier. But when you look in the mirror, you’re greeted with swollen red eyes and tinges of spittle on your mouth. It’s as unattractive as you’ll look all day. You look like you felt before you threw up: sick. I can still see my face from that night. Bloated, flushed. I remember looking at my eyes and thinking, “What the fuck are you doing to yourself?”
But then, after I washed up, I thought, “Well, you’ve just thrown up all that wine you drank. You enjoyed it before you felt sick. You should get more.” But getting more meant driving. I contemplated bed. It was 12:15 am. I should go to bed. Then, I don’t want to go to bed. Then, if I stay up, I need alcohol. Then, you shouldn’t drive. Then, you have to.  
So, I drove to 7-11 with one eye squeezed shut to avoid seeing double. I bought a bottle of white wine. I drove home. I sat back down on the couch. I started to drink, but was durnk enough that a whole other movie seemed like to much of an investment. TV shows seemed too slow-paced to bother with. Video games were simply off the table—my coordination was too impaired. So I did what I’ve done dozen of times when too drunk to do anything else: I put on youtube compilations of soldiers coming home to their families and pets. Those videos always make me cry when I’m drunk. Hard. And I liked being able to cry like that. It was cathartic. It made me feel for the soldiers, families, and pets. Like I was along for their incredible journey. I watched those compilations and drank wine and cried until the wine was gone. Things are very hazy to me at this point. I don’t remember how long I watched. I know at some point after the wine was gone, I stood up, extremely drunk, and stumbled to bed. It was well after 2:00 am. 
My Thursday night had turned from wanting to relax and to only have the slightest buzz to blacking out, driving drunk, and forcing myself to throw up. All for what? To watch Donnie Darko? And the hangover. Dear lord. I was incapacitated for the entire day. I looked godawful. I remember being consciously ashamed of going to the grocery store to buy dinner. I didn’t want anyone to see me. I just knew if they got too close, they’d smell the liquor. They see the exhaustion on my face and wonder what I had done the night before. They would pity me, wonder why someone my age would look like that on a Friday afternoon. 
Worse, when I woke up, I noticed a dull pain under my rib cage, on my right side. This was a new sensation. A pain beside my stomach? What could that be? I figured it must be some sort of indigestion due to my wretching the previous night. I figured it would go away as the day progressed. 
It did not go away. It remained a dull ache, right below the bottom of my ribs, on my right side. I didn’t know it at the time, but this is the exact location of the liver. Likewise, I did not know at the time, but the ache I experienced in indicative of a liver in danger. When a person drinks alcohol to excess, and especially over long periods (I drank regularly from college-aged to my late thirties), the liver begins to swell. There is no way to feel the swelling develop. The liver does not contain nerve endings the same way our skin does. Biologically speaking, there would be little point. The liver constantly processes harmful toxins out of our bloodstream. It catalyzes millions of chemical reactions a second, turning useless chemicals into useful ones. If damaged, it can regenerate its own tissue. Imagine being able to feel this activity. Especially if you were constantly throwing toxic poisons like ethanol at it. You would be uncomfortable all the time. Hangovers from drinking wouldn’t be headaches, they’d be immediate body aches. Although, from a health-conscious perceptive, this may not be such a bad thing. 
The way you feel your liver is when it swells to the point of bumping into neighboring, sensitive organs like the gallbladder, right kidney and adrenal gland, diaphragm, intestines, and stomach. This is the point where you may be in danger of all manner of liver diseases. Fatty Liver. Alcoholic Hepatitis. Cirrhosis. Bacterial Abscess. And of course, cancer. Again, I didn’t know this at the time. I thought I had simply drank too much and given myself some sort of super-charged indigestion. 
That pain stayed with me for one week during that week I didn’t drink. So horrific was the hangover, and so embarrassed was I from my actions, I found alcohol to be abhorrent. The hangover lasted days. I was weak and tired all day long. I had no motivation to work. I was forced to remain in the supine position, watching TV, playing video games. Just the same stuff I wanted to do to relax when I started drinking that night. The irony is not lost on me. 
Did I stop drinking at this point? No. After a week, I felt strong and energetic again, and a drink sounded like just the thing to reward myself. Insane. When I think about it now, I can liken the night of drinking to a night of slowly ingesting a poison like bleach or ammonia. Just like those chemicals, ethanol will disinfect and clean all manner of things. In fact, chemically, it’s a perfect solvent for cleaning. It’s used in laboratories the world over to disinfect tools before and after procedures. Strange how we dump the same thing we use to disinfect surgical scalpels into our bodies as a reward for getting through a week. 
What does all of this have to do with kratom? Perhaps you already know. The same way I went from sober to driving drunk, throwing up, blacking out, developing a dull pain in my chest, and suffering the mother of all hangovers, to drinking again after only a handful of days is the same way I took kratom despite its obvious health side effects. Everyone has different experiences, but with chronic kratom abuse, some of the more common health side effects are constipation, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, liver damage, cardiac issues such as tachycardia (increased heart rate), hypertension (high blood pressure), and arrythmias (irregular heartbeat), kidney stones, shedding of hair from the scalp, reduced testosterone levels, disrupted menstrual cycles, skin problems such as itching, rashes, and poor complexion, difficulty sleeping, and seizures. This doesn’t even touch the mental side effects, such as depression, social isolation, anxiety, stress, and withdrawal-inducing dependence. 
If you’ve been using kratom at high levels for a long period, I’d bet you’ve experienced at least one if not several of the symptoms above, and likely at least one not listed. And if I ever, ever, presented you with a product I bought at a gas station and showed you this list, you would 100% tell me you were not interested in it. Even if I told you that you would get a brief energy boost from it, you’d tell me, “No thank you, I’ll stick to my energy drinks.” And if I told you it would improve your focus, you’d say, “Twenty minutes of focus for losing my hair? No, thank you.” Perhaps if I told you that if you took it, you’d feel an intense euphoria for fifteen to thirty minutes, you’d be inclined to agree to try it. Chances are, I this is the case, then you’re inclined to try it because you’ve already had an encounter with an opioid, and my comment triggers some old craving pathway in your head. That craving is powerful. It can cloud out rational judgements. You may suddenly feel a strong urge to recreate that euphoria you used to get when taking the other opioid. And you may say, “Well, alright, I’ll try it once. no harm in trying it.” 
Of course, this would be completely discounting what you already know about opioids. That there is no such thing as trying it once. You may have even learned this lesson the hard way.  Maybe even more than once. “Just once” may as well be carved onto the gateway to addiction. If you’re addicted to kratom, you are constantly putting yourself at risk for all the health side effects I listed above. And, like I mentioned, you’ve probably got your own special unfortunate side effect. All of which go ignored in the name of maintaining the drug habit. 
My special unfortunate side effect was a heavy numbness in my left arm. A few months before I quit kratom for good, I started to experience a curious phenomenon when I woke up. Every morning, as soon as I got out of bed, I’d notice that my left arm and hand were still fast asleep and numb. And heavy. It was as if I’d slept on my arm over the night. And like an extra pint of blood got stuffed into the veins and arteries. It was like having someone else’s arm instead of my own. I could use my fingers and move my arm around no problem, but there was a constant ache throughout the appendage, and a quite painful sensation in my left palm. My palm—when I got up—was always swollen, noticeably larger than my right palm. This swelling was palpable. It didn’t ache like my arm, it hurt. Like a swollen ankle. If I made a fist with my left hand, it felt like my palm would explode with blood. I still shudder thinking about it. 
I can’t recall when exactly this numb, heavy, achy problem with my left arm and hand appeared, but I do know that I endured it for about one month befor ei went to the hospital to get it checked on. See, throughout the day, the numbness would go away. The heaviness would be lightened. The pain in my palm would subside. In other words, the arm would return to normal. However, if I were to go for a walk for more than ten minutes, the characteristic swinging of my arms with my gait would create the same symptoms that I woke with. Going for a walk became unpleasant. I would have to hold my left hand on my hip to keep it still. It didn’t fix the unpleasant sensations, but it slowed their growing intensity. It also made me look like I was nursing some sort of hip injury. It was also an example of me failing to take the cpndition seriously, instead looking for a wuick and easy way to mask the problem. 
After about a month of dealing with this, I went to urgent care early one Saturday morning. I didn’t have an appointment, so I sat in the waiting room for two hours until a practitioner was available. I went into a consulting room and explained the problems I was having. I told him I would wake up with a heavy, numb arm, and that my palm felt so swollen that I could barely close a fist. He asked me many questions and ordered a few blood tests. But he was perplexed. Nice enough guy, but this was a conundrum to him. I hadn’t done anything to injure the arm. I didn’t have a history of poor circulation. Ultimately, he told me to go to the hospital and get properly checked out. He put in an ultrasound request. I thanked him and went to the emergency room at the hospital around the corner. They admitted me and I told them the same thing I told the man at urgent care. And by them, I mean no less than five different nurses and doctors. Despite how busy the hospital was, I was granted a wide audience to the hospital staff. What I described—originally to just a nurse, then two nurses, then three, then four and a doctor—left them at a loss. I seemed in great health. My vitals were normal. I hadn’t had any injuries. Nothing conspicuous. No outstanding events of any kind. Nothing that could precipitate such a localized affectation. I’ll never forget how they looked at me, quasi-dumbfounded. They felt my arm and palm. They retook my vitals. They had me perform strength tests with my left arm. All was normal. Eventually, after maybe thirty minutes of fussing over me, the doctor declared it was probably carpal tunnel syndrome. “Carpal tunnel syndrome?” I thought. “Isn’t that what happens to people who spend too much typing emails?”
The medical staff left me alone in the consulting room, none of them looking convinced, as one of them went to procure a wrist brace. She came back in a few minutes and showed me how to strap it in place. She then instructed me that my ultrasound was ready, and I should head upstairs to the imaging department. I twisted my wrist left and right, trying to get used to the new stiffness of the brace. It felt wildly misdiagnosed. “Carpal tunnel syndrome? No way,” I kept thinking.  
The ultrasound was performed in a dark room by a man that barely spoke. It was an odd experience. I felt like I was in some forgotten wing of the hospital. Arm lubed up to the point of being slightly cold. The guy who performed the ultrasound didn’t look at me. I looked at a framed copy of an abstract painting, something that I could barely make out in the darkness. It took about 30 minutes. I got cleaned up. I thanked the man. He nodded. I walked back to the main floor of the hospital and checked out. By now, it was getting to be late afternoon. My whole day has been spent trying to figure out what was wrong with me. And the conclusion? Carpal tunnel syndrome. I knew, absolutely knew, that this wasn’t true. 
I also knew, deep down, what the true culprit of the problem was. Unfortunately, I had completely and utterly failed to tell any of the medical staff I saw that day what I suspected the culprit to be.  Maybe, if I told them I was crushing kratom extract shots every day, and has been doing so for almost a year, they would’ve given me a completely different diagnosis. I wouldn’t have been sent to the strange, dark ultrasound room and then released with nothing more than a pitiful little carpal tunnel syndrome wrist brace. Perhaps, if I had told them that I was addicted to kratom, they would’ve nodded in understanding from the get go, and told me that circulatory problems are common to opioid use disorder. Bu then, they certainly would’ve told me to stop using. They may even have told me to enter a treatment program. They probably would’ve looked at me differently. At least, I imagine they would’ve. “Why is this guy ruining his life with this stuff?” would be all over their faces. “What a shame.” “Yet another sad story.” “Is it lunchtime yet?” I was already judging myself intensely for my habit. I didn’t want anyone else to judge me. 
You may be wondering, if I wasn’t intending to tell anyone what I really thought was causing the problems with my arm, why I even bothered going to the hospital. Well, I wanted to know if I was actually in danger. I needed to know if I was actually causing damage to my body. If I was, maybe I’d stop taking kratom. In fact, I think I was secretly hoping they’d tell me I was in mortal danger. I had been looking for any and all excuses to finally push me to the point of quitting kratom. That trip to the hospital wasn’t about truth telling. It was about trying to find a way to shock me into quitting. Imagine my disappointment when I came away from a full day of medical inspection to a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal freaking tunnel syndrome. 
My ultrasound results came back within the next week. I held out hope for something of interest. No luck. All was normal. And that was the end of it, from the hospital’s perspective. I was advised to wear my wrist brace when typing. That was it. Except, of course, it wasn’t. and I knew it. 
I threw the brace away. Life continued on as usual. My habit did not abate by any measure. And, a month after that day spent wasted at medical facilities, with people eager to help me but who hadn’t been given information that could’ve helped them help me, I got the bill for their services. $2,300. That’s right: over two thousand dollars. I was livid. I blamed my insurance. I even called them and levied complaints about how there was no way I should’ve been charged so much. They explained, calmly, that emergency visits were not covered until my deductible was reached. I tried to argue, but to no avail. 
That’s when I went from feeling frustrated at the stupidity of the medical visit (carpal tunnel syndrome??) to feeling shame and sadness. Not only had I not solved my numbness and pain in my left arm, but I had wasted a whole day on a hospital campus and been charged over two thousand dollars for the privilege. I didn’t even have the wrist brace anymore. All I had to commemorate the hospital visit was a bill. This bill, in addition to the $50-a-day kratom habit I was maintaining put brand new strain on my finances. I felt like I just threw thousands of dollars out a window. I was worse off, substantially, than I was before going to the hospital. That’s not how that kind of thing is supposed to work. 
Except. When you’re hiding an addiction from everyone except for yourself, that’s exactly how that kind of thing works. I had every opportunity that day, in both urgent care and the emergency room, to tell trained medical professionals what the true cause of my problem was. And I chose to hide the truth. They were rightly confused by my description of the problem. They rightly misdiagnosed the cause.  
And perhaps worst of all, I had hoped that the hospital visit would give me enough motivation to quit my habit. Nope. All it did was cost me time and money. Is that a surprise to anyone? I doubt it. Addiction makes smart people act stupidly. It makes honest people tell lies. Addiction protects itself. It’s like a bear watching its bear cubs—if anything threatening gets too close, it roars and charges. So many times during my addiction, I ha the chance to tell people who cared about me why I looked so tired, or couldn’t walk straight, or had to go out for a cup of coffee at 3:00 pm, and I made up excuses every time. Or at least, I left out the truth. My addiction was protecting itself. If I told the truth, the addiction might have to end. 
I kept waking up with numbness and ache in my left arm and hand until I quit kratom. That was a period of roughly 3 months. It became yet another unfortunate addition to my life that I learned to live with so I could maintain the addiction. I’d wager that if you’re reading this book, you’ve got your own version of this story. Where you had every opportunity to tell the truth and expose your addiction, but you chose to hide it. Where people could’ve helped you, or you could’ve helped yourself, but you chose to protect your relationship to kratom. Don’t you see how perverted that is? Kratom doesn’t care about you at all. In fact, it cares so little for you that it causes significant health and financial problems for you. Blatantly. Without remorse. Daily numbness and ache in your left arm? Deal with it. $2,300 hospital bill? Oh well. 
As long as kratom is pulling the strings in your mind, you’ll walk through health and financial problems. You know this already. You know that you don’t get anything but suffering in return. Kratom actively wreaks havoc on your life, and you find excuses to keep taking it. the true definition of an unhealthy, toxic, problematic relationship. All this, for a few moments of euphoria? You know that this is a bad deal. If you hired a contractor to remodel your home, and came back in a year to see that the contractor had torn out every wall and smashed every piece of furniture you own, how mad would you be? Would you pay him? Of course not. Yet, kratom does the same thing to our minds and life, and we keep buying more. 
The only way to stop putting yourself at risk of such unnecessary circumstances is to see once and for all that kratom is the one responsible for them. A every turn, kratom chooses itself over you. It protects itself over your health. It demands loyalty over your financial welfare. It commands you to feed it over your sense of integrity. How many things are you still willing to sacrifice for your habit? For kratom? For something that doesn’t care about you one single iota? You’ve pledged your life to maintaining a habit that takes no hesitation in taking. Remember, addiction makes honest people lie. And in return for turning you into a liar, kratom steals your health and your money. And above all—it steals your time on this planet that could otherwise have been spent turning your life into the life you want. Maintaining a drug habit leaves absolutely no space for achieving your goals. Picture kratom as the executioner of your dreams. That’s what it really is.  It kills your precious time on this planet. It demands your full loyalty and gives nothing in return. It’s time to rise up and up and put kratom in its place. No more submission, no more lying. Kratom can’t steal from you if you don’t let it. And now that you are seeing it for what it truly is: an enemy, an executioner of your dreams, a thief of your health and wealth, you should be feeling one thing: a righteous sense of disdain. Kratom deserves your disdain for what it has done to you. You have no obligation to nurture its feelings any more than you do to maintain a habit that keeps it in your life. If a burglar broke into your home and started stealing your possessions and smashing your home to pieces, would you invite him to permanently move in, or would you do everything in your power to get him out? Kratom is the same. And you are under absolutely zero obligation to treat it with anything less than righteous disdain. It doesn’t belong in your life. It deserves absolutely none of your time nor attention, let alone money. Kratom is an addictive drug that does not care about you. The only thing you have to do to get kratom out of your life for good is treat it the same way it treats you. Make no mistake: kratom adds no value to your life. If steals from you. It doesn’t add any benefit. It kills your time. Kratom is as useful to you as a bee sting. And you are under no obligation to keep taking it. In fact, the second you stop taking it, and end your relationship for good, you will add so much value and benefit to your life that you will be absolutely stunned. 
I take kratom to manage stress
Stress is about as pleasant as a sprained ankle. It creeps into our conscious minds and wreaks havoc on our sense of stability. Stress is the little voice in the back of your head that whispers, “This could all go very wrong,” or “What if something bad happens?” It is unpleasant for everyone, in any situation. It gets such a bad reputation that you might be wondering why we have to experience stress at all.
The Oxford English dictionary defines stress as “a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very demanding circumstances,” or “subject to pressure or tension.” I understand that the second definition primarily relates to the realm of physics, but it’s fairly accurate from a mental standpoint. Stress by definition makes it difficult for the body and mind to relax. 
From an evolutionary standpoint, however, stress is essential for survival. “Fight or flight” responses to environmental stimuli help humans react quickly in dangerous situations. Throughout most of human existence, this sort of response would help humans escape from predators. It triggers the release of adrenaline and cortisol, both of which prepare the body to respond to external threats. “Flight or flight” stress responses increase heart rate, redirect blood to muscles, sharpen focus, and heighten sensory perception. From this perspective, it’s easy to see exactly why stress is not only beneficial, but crucial for survival.
In terms of dealing with pressure or tension, imagine being stuck in a situation that requires a particular tool to escape. Think of a bear trap or a jail cell. You need a winch to open the trap and a key to open the cell. The stress that would be induced from being stuck in either the trap or the cell has been shown to not only improve focus and boost energy, but to drive innovation. In other words, if you didn’t have a winch or a key, you would find a way to make one. Furthermore, if the winch proved particularly difficult to turn, you may find a reservoir of strength that you didn’t know you had in your stressed out state.
Finally, the isolation and depression that can result from being socially disconnected can cause significant mental stress. The unpleasant feeling of, “I am alone,” can drive human beings to engage in social bonding and cooperation. This is a especially true during challenging times. Even if you are an introvert, if you were going through a particularly difficult period in your life, you are more likely to seek out contact with your social network than you would otherwise. And from a survival standpoint, human beings could not make it on their own for the vast majority of human mankind history. The only way to survive would be to band together as a community to increase survival odds against predators or rival groups.
In other words, stress is built to the human psyche, the same as any other human emotion. This is a double edged sword. We no longer live in times of being hunted by wild animals. We no longer have to come together as a group to hunt food. Cole and gasoline have allowed us to have the exact temperatures we desire in our homes and the ability to travel around the world whenever we want. Survival is far easier now than it has ever been. Therefore, we have to cope with the presence of stress in our lives without the justifications that used to bring it on. It’s an odd premise. Stress was beneficial in the context of acute short-term challenges, such as avoiding mortal danger and providing for basic needs like food, water, and shelter. Chronic stress, however, in modern life, can lead to shorter lifespan and negative health outcomes. These chronic stresses, due to things like work, finances, and personal relationships, have come to dominate the release of adrenaline and cortisol. But there is no immediate escape from these stresses. They are almost existential. They live with us like bad roommates.
Chronic stress keeps blood pressure high, increase in the risk of hypertension and damaged blood vessels. It suppresses the production of white blood cells and thus weakens the immune system. It can create gastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers. It can even create cognitive decline, as high cortisol levels from stress can damage the hippocampus a brain region critical for memory and learning. 
Since chronically stressful situations have become part and parcel with modern life, it is not a surprise that human beings look for ways to break free from it. No one enjoys existential dread generated from working in a job that they hate, wondering if they’ll have enough money for food and rent each month, or how to repair damaged relationships with once-close loved ones. Indeed stress, from a biological perspective, exists solely to safely propel you away from adverse intense situations. It is not something that is meant to stick around. But how are human beings supposed to deal with chronic, existential stress? Should they go to therapy? Or wellness retreat? Should they drop everything that they have and move to a new country? Should they quit their jobs? No good long-term answer is available. 
In the absence of good, long-term answers, human beings have a propensity to turn to bad, short-term answers. If you have ever told yourself that Kratom helps you deal with the stresses of the day, then you know exactly what I’m talking about. Remember, stress is a biological response to adverse or challenging situations. Adrenaline and cortisol are released in the brain to have specific impact on your energy, focus, motivation, creativity, and awareness. Stress is there to help you. It sounds crazy, but it wouldn’t even exist unless it was evolutionarily advantageous. Stress is a red flag that waves and says here’s a scenario that requires an in ordinate amount of our attention, get the body ready.
At the same time, stress creates very unpleasant feelings. Anxiety, self out, increased heart rate, uncertainty, and perhaps most important, and inability to feel like you have control over your current circumstance. No one wants to exist in these feelings. Especially every day, with no end in sight, as is the case with chronic stress. But no good, long-term solution presents itself, it becomes incredibly easy to look for bad, short-term solutions. Enter kratom. 
Chronic stress has been led to an increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, including kratom. Particularly stressful life events, and adverse childhood experiences, can make people predisposed to seek relief through euphoria inducing drugs, like kratom. This is where the concept of self-medication comes into play. People often use Kratom to alleviate stress or emotional pain, as the euphoria induced by the drug temporarily relieves unpleasant feelings due to stress. Kratom acts both on the brain’s reward and stress systems. In addition to the euphoric high that it produces, kratom reduces the release of stress hormones like cortisol, which provides a common effect. Unfortunately, any relief from the unpleasant feelings of stress is therefore “artificial.” Taking Kratom to relieve stress alters nothing about the factors that created the stress in the first place. The stressors continue to exist outside of the influence of the drug, and are there, waiting to pounce, once the effects of the drug wear off. This creates a feedback loop where people rely on Kratom to manage their stress, as the underline reasons for the stress are never dealt with but are instead suppressed. The suppression reinforces Kratom use and dependence.
Once this feedback loop is in place, even slightly stressful situations can serve as triggers for taking kratom. Perhaps you have taken Kratom before making a phone call. Or before meeting up with friends that you’ve known for years. Or even as part of your morning routine, to get you prepped for the day. If stressful situations begin to trigger cravings for Kratom, this creates a powerful for drug seeking behavior, since life is never in any shortage of stressful situations. This is one of the primary reasons that people relapse and recovering from Kratom addiction. Life will never not be stressful. If you have trained your brain to Kratom during stressful situations, no matter how slight they may be, the brain will crave what you have trained it to take to cope with the stress. 
Furthermore, chronic Kratom use will alter your brains stress systems in general, making them more sensitive to stress (a condition known as stress, hyper sensitivity). What used to bother you only a tiny amount may bother you to a significant degree. You were probably already aware of what this feels like. When you were chronically addicted to Kratom, molehills become mountains. Accomplishing simple tasks or chores becomes an exercise in motivation. You may start avoiding social situations. You might stop participating in activities that you used to join in on a consistent basis. That’s because all of the scenarios contain some load of stress. Some unit amount. That amount never used to bother you to the point of giving up. However, when you are in a state of hypersensitive stress, this unit amount seems insurmountable. What do addicts do when they feel like they are faced with an insurmountable stress? They use. 
Finally, with chronic Kratom use, your body builds tolerance and dependence on the drug, leading to withdrawals when you stop taking it. At this point, Kratom ceases to become a coping mechanism for stress. It instead becomes a generator of stress. Severe stress. Long-term Kratom use disrupts normal functioning of stress systems within the brain to the point where during withdrawals stress, warm level spike leading to overwhelming feelings of, you guessed it, distress. The brain already knows that there’s one way to stop the distress. Again, you guessed it, take Kratom. 
If you’ve tried to quit Kratom before, you know what I’m talking about. You’ve certainly felt the agitation, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, and general distress that can be brought on by withdrawal symptoms. It is the pinnacle of irony that the substance you took to cope with even slightly stressful situations can become the generator of the most severe stress in your life: withdrawals. This is why, if you’ve tried to quit and failed due to the withdrawals, you should never ever blame yourself. It is not your fault. You had no way of knowing that long-term Kratom use physically alters brain regions like the amygdala (involved in stress and fear) and the prefrontal cortex (involved in decision-making), making it harder to cope with stress without drugs. 
But think back to the time before you took Kratom. Think back to a slightly stressful scenario that you faced on a regular basis. Maybe it’s sitting in traffic or standing in line at the grocery store. Maybe it’s making a phone call or going to a meeting at work. Maybe it’s getting ready to do household chores are cooked dinner. Were any of those situations really stressful? To the point of needing medication? No. Of course not. And you didn’t start taking Kratom to “deal” with those situations. You started taking Kratom to deal with the chronic stresses in your life. The existential stresses. And you almost certainly knew that Kratom would only provide a brief and ultimately meaningless release from the tension brought on by those stresses. You certainly knew that by the time the effects of the drug wore off, those stresses were still there and as powerful as ever. In fact, overtime, those stresses likely multiplied and got stronger. That’s the nature of stress, if you failed to deal with the root causes, it fails to disappear. And when you take bad short-term solutions to dealing with stress, you prevent yourself from being able to deal with those root causes.
Kratom doesn’t relieve your stress, it merely masks the fact that you are stressed. It multiplies the severity of the stress in your life by altering the physical make up of your brain to make your more sensitive to stressful situations. It prevents you from taking a look at the factors in your life that are causing you stress and dealing with them the way that you need to in order to make them disappear. Convinces you that if you take it, you are relieving the stress in your life, when in reality, all you’re doing is putting the stress off by a matter of 30 to 60 minutes. If you’ve ever felt like your nerves were on edge after taking some elevated dose of Kratom, it’s because they were. Kratom does not just create a sense of euphoria, it directly impacts the physiology of your stress release systems. The more you take Kratom to “deal with stress,” the more your subconscious comes to believe that stressful situations need to be paired with Kratom. And since Kratom systematically impairs your bodies, ability to successfully deal with stressful situations, you are actually lowering your tolerance to stress with every dose of Kratom that you take.
This is the nightmare of addiction. The thing that you took to cope with a problem in your life has now not only become a problem in your life, but has destroyed your resilience in dealing with any problem in your life. But the second you stop taking it, withdrawals set in. Withdrawals can be incredibly severe; they re-create all of the unpleasant feelings that acute, short-term, dangerous, challenging, adverse, and tense situations would create. This is how Kratom traps you. It takes all of your ability to cope with a normal life and throws it in the trash. If you try to stop taking it, it throws you in the trash. It is the ultimate liar and the thief. If you ever need convincing that Kratom doesn’t care about you, this is your reason.
The fear trap
Addict face a remarkable paradox. They are stuck between choosing to take a drug that used to bring them a perceived pleasure, and continuing to take a drug that they are certain is bringing them pain. From an outsiders perspective, it would seem as straightforward as anything: if you were taking something that is bringing you pain, just stop taking it. But it’s not that simple. Addicts are caught trying to figure out just how bad life will be without the drug that used to give them the perceived pleasure and how bad life will be if they continue to take the drug. This is difficult enough on its own . but when it’s paired with fear, it becomes truly difficult indeed. 
I believe that fear is the number one contributing factor to the maintenance of addiction. Creates the ultimate mental cognitive dissonance: you are afraid to stay on the drug, yet you were afraid of what life will be like if you are sober. No matter what the drug has done to your life you still retain some sort of positive perception of what the drug can do for you. Let’s say you, Kratom to manage your stress. Even though you know, beyond the shadow of a doubt that Kratom has now created more stress In your life than you had before you started taking it you are unsure of how you’re going to manage stress without it. This lack of surety is frightening. Uncertainty in general breeds fear. Addicts who are looking to quit a drug for good often feel like they are looking over a precipice and being told to jump. The life that they have gotten so used to maintaining will come to an abrupt end and be replaced by a life that they have experienced since they started using. 
Anything new instinctually breeds fear in human beings. This is the part of the nature of being a human being. The fear of loss far out ways imagined benefits, regardless of scenario. In the case of the addict, the fear of loss concerns the abandonment of the lifestyle that he she has developed and maintained. Again, this is in spite of all of the detriment that the drug has done. In fact, this has nothing to do with whether or not the drug was holy beneficial or holy destructive. From an evolutionary basis, survival often depended on knowing in controlling one’s environment. Familiarity meant safety while unfamiliar situations posed potential threats, such as predation starvation or social rejection. Familiarity may as well be an analog for certainty in this case. An addict is completely certain of his daily routine, even if it brings him abject misery. There is a comfort certainty that should not be underestimated. The threat of change, brought on by feelings of uncertainty and unfamiliarity, can create an involuntary fight or flight response in the brains sphere centers, particularly the amygdala, which is a stress center for the brain. Even if the proposed change is ultimately extremely positive this won’t stop the brain’s fear centers from becoming activated. This is why we can become extremely nervous and agitated at the thought of approaching someone we are particularly attracted to. We are about to enter of realm of complete uncertainty. Will we be liked? Will we be rejected? It’s impossible to know ahead of time. 
The same holds true for addict who are close to approaching a sober life. They know, deep down, that sobriety is the answer to their problems, and yet the loss of predictability that’s sobriety may bring creates a feeling of tension and apprehension. Human beings have a natural desire for certainty. Change introduces ambiguity, unfamiliarity, and uncertainty, all of which make it harder to predict outcomes, which feels inherently, threatening. Threats induce fear. Similarly, threats, create the perception of risk. Human beings are naturally risk averse. Our brains are hardwired to overestimate risks and underestimate our ability to cope, to prevent ourselves from engaging in dangerous situations. When we overestimate risks and underestimate our ability to cope, we become extremely fearful that we simply don’t have what it takes to change.
It may sound crazy to anyone who has never experienced the addiction, but to an addict, the thought of sobriety might bring such intense, nervous anxiety that it actually drives the person to use drugs. Remember, using drugs to cope with stress is one of the most common reasons for the development of addiction. When the thought of sobriety itself brings on significant stress, the first thing that will do is use. It is yet another cruel and unfortunate side effect of drug addiction. The drug has become such an integral part of the users life that even imagining a life without the drug activates, the brain’s fear centers.
Crucially, when an addict imagines a sober life, no matter how happy that life may appear in their imagination they tend to experience a wave of dread. This dread stems from the incorrect belief that they don’t have what it takes to succeed at sobriety. The fear of failure can be so extreme that it actually induces a level of self-shame on par with actually going sober and then relapsing. The fear centers of the brain catastrophize a life of sobriety before sobriety is even reached. This is underscored by the fact that our brains tend to focus on the potential downsides of Change rather than the opportunities. It might bring amplifying any fears. Cognitive bias for the status quo involuntarily pushes people to what’s familiar, even if it’s so optimal, because what is familiar is safe. 
So what is it about sober life that can seem so scary? Perhaps you imagine that the predictable patterns of your life will be altered to the point where you won’t know how to make it through the day. Perhaps you were uncertain about how daily life looks to a former addict. Perhaps you feel like you no longer have what it takes to cope with daily life now that you’ve spent time addicted to a drug. Perhaps you imagine the challenges of normal life are simply too great and you are too weak. Perhaps you are afraid of relapsing and therefore won’t even give yourself the chance to try sobriety. Perhaps you were so used to using a drug to obtain pleasure that you no longer believe that things can be pleasurable without the drug. Perhaps you feel that you were simply so deep into your addiction that there is no hope for you to live a sober life.
The good news is, even if you think this way, it is extremely easy to point out why this line of thinking is incorrect. In fact, it’s not even your voice thinking these thoughts—it’s Kratom. Repeated use of Kratom conditions your behavior. The subconscious mind learns to associate Kratom use with stress, relief or pleasure or an escape from pain. Over time, these associations become automatic. Whether or not they are true is not important to your subconscious. Your brain has become hardwired to think certain things one presented with the concept of Kratom use and Kratom cessation. We’ve already established that when you were addiction was taking route it was doing so with incomplete or incorrect information to guide it. You had no idea when you started using Kratom that you were rewiring your brain subconsciously encourage you to construct an addiction. Using the principle of Neuroplasticity, we can undo the effects of Kratom and the subconscious, automatic line of negative thinking that it produces.
Even after years of chronic Kratom use, the brain can rewire itself to form healthy habits and associations. Engaging in recovery, focused behaviors like reading. This book can weaken the pathways associated with the habit and strengthen those link to self-control and reliance. Principle the subconscious mind can be retrained. We can reframe our core beliefs by identifying and reprogramming our subconscious thought patterns that fueled our addictions. We can replace fear and doubt with empowerment and belief. 
All that it takes to undo the negative programming done by Kratom is to expose kratom for the fraud that it is. So if you’re afraid of going sober, let’s start to undress those fears and expose them for the smoke and mirrors that they are. 
Fear: Withdrawals will be unbearable and painful
Reality: Withdrawals are temporary, and each day brings the body new levels of relief. It is nothing more than a physical indication that your body has begun the healing process. Proper supplement support, such as the Quit Kit, can ease symptoms significantly. Withdrawals are temporary manifestations of your body’s cleansing process. When they are over, they do not return. Continuing to take kratom only guarantees that withdrawals always lay ahead of you, and never behind. 
Fear: I won’t be able to handle stress or emotions without substances
Reality: kratom has compounded your daily stresses beyond anything you  could have expected. It has seized control from your mental faculties and placed you into a perpetual servitude. It has altered the chemical structure of your brain’s stress centers to make you hypersensitive to even the slightest stressors. What was once a breeze to endure now feels like an insurmountable task. Kratom has eroded your health, drained your wallet, and forced you into keeping secrets from your friends and loved ones. It is the ultimate creator of stress in your life. Only by stopping you kratom intake will you come back to your strong, resilient self. The stresses in your life that seem insurmountable today will appear as mere shadows of themselves when you remove the root cause of their might: kratom.
Fear: “What if I try sobriety and fail? What if I relapse? I’ll feel worse about myself than I do now.”
Reality: Impossible. The bravest people on planet earth are the people who face down their own demons. There will be no greater battle than the self against the self. Make no mistake, the instant that you decide to quit kratom is the instant that your inner lion, tiger, and bear come alive and snap their jaws. The inner strength that you’ve had all along will be on full display. Relapse has nothing to do with it. You will truly be astonished at just how much gusto and vigor lie inside you, once you decide to put your kratom addiction behind you. If you’ve ever imagined yourself fighting some righteous battle for the sake of honor and pride—you’ve found your battle. There is no greater honor than fighting to take back control of your life. Do not even consider what it is like to fail. Consider what it will feel like to get control of your life back. I challenge you not to feel an indelible excitement at the prospect of annihilating your relationship with kratom. Burn it. Kill it with fire. Demolish it. Send your lion, tiger, and bear horde to rip it to shreds. Relish in the pleasure that thought produces.
Fear: Sobriety will force me to confront emotions I’ve been avoiding.”
Reality: 99% of life’s problems can be solved by taking action. 0% of them can be solved by drugs. If you are in a job you hate, and the misery you feel at that job is what led you to start taking kratom, then you know exactly what you need to fix: your job. Whether that’s a candid conversation with your boss or the search for a new position at a different company, or starting your own business, there will never be any change in your job satisfaction until you make a change. The same goes for your financial situation. If you are experiencing poverty, or are bad at handling money, there is one surefire way to improve your financial fortune, and you already know what it is: stop taking kratom. That one is easy. When you set yourself free from kratom, there will be a significant windfall in your bank account. This is a massive benefit to quitting. The sheer savings of being sober tally in the tens of thousands a year for some. If you have a bad relationship with a loved one, and took kratom to cope with the mental anguish, you already know that kratom has only made that problem worse. The way to solve problems with loved ones is to communicate. Whether that’s through therapy or not, most interpersonal problems are matters of differing perspectives and the preservation of pride. If you want to improve your relationship, have the talk you’ve been avoiding, and be prepared to sacrifice your ego in the process. There is simply no bad outcome from this approach. Remember, absolutely none of the negative emotions in your life will go away until you solve the problems that create them. And none of the problems have ever, nor ever will be, solved by drugs. 
Fear: “I’ll lose friends and be lonely”
Reality: Your friends are your friends are your friends. Underneath any argument you may have had with any friend, there is love. That will simply never change. Your friends won’t leave you behind if you get sober—they’ll cheer you on more vehemently than you can imagine. As soon as they know what kind of suffering you’ve been dealing with, they will stand up to support you however they can. You most certainly will not lose a friend because you quit kratom. Now, if there are some people that don’t return your phone calls when you tell them you’re going clean, then quit simply, they’re not friends, and should be cut from your life as soon as possible. Furthermore, if anyone ever tells you that you won’t be as fun without getting high, they are a) wrong, and b) suffering far more than you. That kind of statement always comes from a place of personal pain, and never from honesty. Their pain is not your responsibility. One of the best things about getting clean from kratom for me was that I actually felt more compelled to call my friends and family on a regular basis. And they always welcomed the call. My relationships became richer. This is 100% due to the fact that I was no longer hiding something from them. The truth is, the most endearing relationships are borne from honesty and trust, and the second you lose your addiction, you become more honest and more trusting. Your relationships automatically get better the instant you get clean. 
Fear: “Kratom is a big part of who I am now. What will I be without it?”
Reality: Great news, this is just the drugs talking. Not to discount the gravity of the sentiment, but this is not you saying this, this is the drugs. Kratom is not who you are. Kratom is a plant. Kratom removes your ability to become your best, authentic self by allowing you to time-shift all your problems to the future. The future inevitably becomes the present, and the problems are as big and bad as they ever were. Your ability to combat these problems and solve them is not enhanced by a plant. It is enhanced by your understanding that you already have everything you need to be fierce and strong. You won’t be some shell of yourself without kratom, and you certainly won’t be missing some crucial part of your identity. Just the opposite. When kratom is removed from your life, all the best parts of you that it convinced you didn’t exist will come flooding back into place. You simply will not believe just how beautiful you really are until you see yourself through sober eyes. Kratom is not a part of you. It never was and never will be. You are you. And you are incredible. 
Fear: “Life without kratom will be dull and joyless”
Reality: False, and demonstrably false. Chronic kratom use produces a mental side effect called anhedonia. Anhedonia is the inability to feel pleasure. When a person takes opioid for long enough, the brain gets so used to having the opioid release significant levels of dopamine that it downregulates the dopamine receptors in the nervous system. This means that everyday pleasures such as eating, socializing, and hobbies no longer trigger the dopamine reward they once did. Furthermore, the body stops producing natural levels of endorphins, the body’s natural “feel good” chemical that binds to opioid receptors. Lower endorphin levels and less sensitive dopamine receptors create a profound disconnect from normally gratifying daily activities. Using too much kratom actually weakens the brain’s ability to enjoy the world, inducing anhedonia. And the only way to compensate for this is to—you guessed it—take more kratom, which activates opioid receptors in the nervous system and clouds over the anhedonia. As soon as you stop taking kratom, the brain recalibrates its pleasure centers to be more sensitive to dopamine and to produce more endorphins. Quitting kratom actually reconnects you to the pleasures of the world.
Fear: “People will judge me for being an addict or for trying to quit.”
Reality: Those who know and love you will be the first to rush to your side and provide support. Make no mistake about this. Imagine your daughter comes to you one day and admits that she has been nursing an opioid addiction in secret, that she is incredibly ashamed of her behavior, and desperately wants to quit. She apologizes to you and starts to cry into her hands. What’s your first, immediate reaction? That’s right—you wrap her up in the biggest, tightest hug you can muster. Imagine that your best friend comes to you with a look of defeat in his eyes and admits he’s been using kratom every time the two of you have been hanging out for the past year.  He says he doesn’t know what to do, and is afraid that he’s going to be trapped in an addiction for the rest of his life. He looks at you  with fear in his eyes. What’s your first, immediate reaction? That’s right—you tell him you are there for him to help however you can. Maybe you wrap him up in a big, tight hug. You would never dream of shaming your daughter or your friend. The only emotion you’d feel would be sympathy. All you’d want to do was help them get better. Rest assured, the people who care about you in your life will have identical reactions to you coming clean about your addiction and your desire to get clean. 
Fear: “Without kratom, I’ll have to take full responsibility for my actions and life.”
Reality: Nothing could be more empowering. There’s a phrase I heard regarding the cycle of addiction that goes, “Nothing changes if nothing changes.” As in, all the problems you’re currently facing will never change until you change the way you life your life. It’s almost crushingly accurate. Nothing changes if nothing changes. Any addiction-related stressors or challenges you face are almost guaranteed to stay in place as long as you keep taking kratom. The second you stop taking it, you make a change. The second you make a change, your life will change with it. Being responsible for your actions is just another way of saying taking back control of your life! Who cares if you make mistakes down the line. We all do. You’re going to mess things up in life. Better to do it on your own terms than under the command of an addictive drug. The second you put responsibility for your actions back into your own life is the second you make a change for the better. And once you change yourself for the better, your life changes for the better in turn. 
Fear: “It’s too late to fix the damages I’ve done to my loved ones.”
Reality: There is a silver bullet to fixing relationships with loved ones in your life. Trust. Everything—every single thing—that creates a loving and beneficial relationship is rooted in trust. The instant you stop engaging in addictive behavior is the instant you cease to become a liar. Remember, all addicts lie. As soon as your loved ones see you take action to improve your life, they will take note. Quitting kratom lays the groundwork for rebuilding trust. Any healing that needs to happen simply must take place after a fertile ground for trust is put in place. The good news is, all it takes to lay such groundwork is to put kratom where it belongs: behind you. The second you quit kratom is the second any hurt relationships can be healed. Trust, not just time, heals all wounds. Quitting kratom is akin to planting a seed of trust. 
Fear: “Without substances, I won’t have an escape from my problems.”
Reality: The funny thing about problems is, no matter how fast you try to outrun them, they run just as fast. The prospect of escaping your problems is built on a false premise. If you take yourself out of the stress your problems create, if only for thirty minutes to an hour, by taking kratom, all you are doing is time-shifting your problems to the future. The future has a 100% success rate of becoming the present. That’s why there is no such thing as escaping your problems. If you get high, you’ll trigger your body’s reward system and feel-good chemicals and you’ll forget about the severity of your problems. But the problems don’t actually go anywhere. And they certainly don’t lessen in severity. If anything, all you are doing by taking kratom to avoid dealing with problems in your life is pressing a snooze button in your mind. The alarm in your mind that warns you of a problem is programmed to encourage you to solve the problem. Pressing snooze does nothing to stop the alarm. It just pushes it out for a brief period of time. And the problems causing the alarm lie in wait for you, the same as they did the first time the alarm went off. You simply can’t escape a problem by pressing snooze. And besides, what infinite torture are you willing to submit yourself to by trying to escape your problems instead of solving them? isn’t it far better to deal with your problems and end them? Dealing with problems may be scary, but nothing is scarier than submitting to a lifetime of addiction. Drugs do not solve problems. They do not provide escape. All they do is push your problems into the future, which soon becomes the present, the same way it was before you tried to escape. Better to face your problems, end them, and escape the perpetual snooze. Only then will your life start to improve by leaps and bounds. Staying on snooze with kratom does one thing and one thing only: guarantee that the problems you have today will be the problems you have tomorrow. 
Fear: “Nothing will feel as good as the high from using.”
Reality: Allow me a digression here. If you believe nothing naturally occurring in the world will bring you the pleasure that kratom brings, let’s follow that thought to its natural conclusion. Take a moment and think of the greatest accomplishment of your life. If you’re a parent, maybe it’s the moment you held your baby in your arms the first time. Focus on that image. How much joy does that image hold for you? How good does it feel?
“The default byproduct of freedom is happiness.” – Craig Beck
Follow me on a visualization exercise. Picture a massive dam holding back an equally massive body of water. Look closely at the face of the dam, and you’ll see it is made out of bricks. Each brick is of a different size. Some are slightly bigger or smaller than the next, and some, especially the ones right in the middle, are enormous. These few, huge bricks account for a majority of the face of the dam. As the dam stands now, not a drop of water can pass through it. It is too strong and too tall. 
Directly below the dam is a valley desperately in need of water. Even a small amount would help it to regrow into the valley it was prior: verdant, lush, and full of life. The massive body of water, just behind the dam, is far more than enough to restore the valley to this state of being. Even a relatively small opening in the dam would give the valley the sufficient quantity of the precious resource it needs. However, the dam stands tall, strong, and immobile. No water flows. 
Now imagine that this dam is entirely of your own construction. And every brick in the face of the dam represents a single problem in your life, some causer of stress or anxiety. Some bricks are trivially small and represent the problems in your life that cost little mental energy. Some bricks, the enormous ones in the middle of the dam, are the largest and most pernicious problems in your life. These problems are the ones that consistently haunt you and cause significant mental anguish. If you were able to solve any of these problems, no matter how large or trivial, the corresponding brick would disappear and the eater behind the dam would begin to flow into the valley below. 
The water that the dam holds back, that massive body of water, represents all of the good things that are waiting to come into your life. These are things that you know are waiting for you, if you could only solve the big problems in your life. They are things that you don’t have to pay for or wait for. They are things that are waiting right now, to enter your life. And the valley below the dam? That’s your life itself. That valley is everything that represents the quality of your life, as you see fit to make it. The more water it receives, the more it thrives. The more it thrives, the better your life is.  And since there is more than enough water stopped up behind the dam to give the valley the nourishment it needs, you know that you need only remove a portion of the bricks in the dam. If you could solve only some of the problems in your life, enough good would enter your life that the whole of the valley floor would be restored to healthy vibrancy. Your life would return to a state of joy and thriving. 
That stated, where would you start? Would you start by tackling all the trivially small problems in your life, thus letting trivially small streams of water through the dam? Or would you see the biggest bricks in the dam, the ones where, if you only took out a couple, or even just the biggest one, a great burst of life-changing water would flow through to the valley? Chances are, you’d work on a few of the big problems, if not focusing on just the biggest one. And if you’re addicted to kratom, then you already know what the biggest brick in the face of the dam is. 
Right there in the center, the strongest, thickest, biggest brick in the whole structure is the addiction. It’s so large that it makes every other brick look small by comparison. It’s so large that you know if you only could remove that one brick, enough water would flow through the dam so as to almost completely return the valley below to life. If you were able to remove the brick of addiction, the remaining large bricks would seem much smaller than they were when they were laid into the dam face. Solving the problems they represent may not be straightforward or easy, but after removing the brick of addiction, your life will already be filled with so much good that it won’t matter. You know that without the addiction, you’ll be stronger, more motivated, healthier, more energetic, more level-headed, better prepared, and far more likely to succeed at solving the problems than you were with the addiction. Again, with that one brick removed from the dam, enough life-changing good will flow into your life that it won’t matter how many of the smaller bricks remain. You’ll be so quickly filled with strength and fortitude that your other problems will seem like shadows of themselves. You won’t need to remove every brick, solve every one of your problems, to get your life back to a flourishing state. This is the beauty of quitting a drug that has come to dominate and destroy your life. It doesn’t matter how much “wrong” there is in your life outside of the addiction. Everything, and I mean everything, gets better when the brick of addiction is removed.
It's worth exploring how ironic this fact is, in light of why addicts first start taking their drug of choice. Addicts often start taking their drug of choice because the drug gives them some escape from the problems in their life. Drugs like kratom, opioids, and alcohol give a very real, and very temporary reprieve from mental anguish by activating the reward centers of the brain. From a chemical standpoint, these drugs serve to anesthetize the mind from worry for a short while. When reward centers are activated in the brain, the stress centers take a backseat. Worry over problems is replaced by brief episodes of relief and relaxation. These episodes are very much like small breaks from the trappings of “real life,” in that they chemically release a brain from negative thoughts and replace the negative thoughts with strong sensations of euphoria or relaxation. When the addict starts the journey to addiction, these episodes are almost too welcome. They seem miraculous. How can one little vial of liquid immediately bring about a reprieve from our problems in the world? Don’t we deserve a break from the stress and anxiety we are often mired within? And in the case of kratom, which binds to the opioid receptors in our nervous system responsible for inducing feelings of euphoria, we not only get a break from worrying over our problems, but we get to feel “good” for a little while. Like swapping the bad things for good things, on demand. 
Again, in the early days of addiction, this ability to swap bad things for good things seems too good to be true is hailed as a wonderful new way to deal with worry and stress. However, in the later days of addiction, when kratom has become the first thing we do in the day and the likely, the last, we are no longer using it to take a break from normal life and feel good for a brief while. We are using it because, if we don’t, the withdrawals we suffer are so strong and brutal that we are forced to enter a state of pure suffering. We wonder how our miracle cure for dealing with the problems in our life has become the biggest, scariest problem of all. And we desperately wish that we could just stop taking kratom. If only we could just stop taking it, we would be able to get our lives back. 
But we keep taking it. And not just to stave off the severity of withdrawal symptoms. We do it also because somewhere, deep in our subconscious, we haven’t let go of the perception that kratom is still a miracle drug. We’ve conditioned ourselves so thoroughly to see kratom as a get-out-of-jail-free card to our worries that when we encounter a problem situation, or feel stress, or anxiety, or worry, or get nervous, or feel self-doubt, we still think that taking kratom is going to give us a break, a little feel-good episode, where we can escape those uncomfortable emotions. That’s why some people who’ve successfully stopped taking kratom and made it through the painful period of acute withdrawals go back to kratom in time. Because it’s that crutch. That way of miraculously escaping their problems. Just for a while. Just until they’re feeling more up to the challenge. 
Of course, every kratom addict knows that this is only a pipe dream. They never feel up to the challenge after taking kratom. It is simply impossible, from a chemical standpoint. The high that kratom briefly provides is replaced quickly by a low that is lower than before the drug was taken. The pleasure-pain balance, after being artificially pushed towards pleasure, is biologically programmed to swing to a point of pain that is lower than before the push. This leaves us feeling worse off than before we took kratom. Far from being better equipped to meet the challenge we were seeking to temporarily escape, we are now less equipped—much less equipped. This is why the miracle cure of “kratom as a crutch” is a mirage and 
will always be a mirage. It is why every kratom addict eventually realizes this in his or her own time. Unfortunately, that period of time from seeing kratom as a miracle crutch to seeing it for what it really is—a thief, enemy, and destroyer of lives—is enough time for the subconscious to associate it with taking pleasurable, episodic breaks from problems, and not as being a sources of problems itself. 
Think back to the dam. The biggest brick in that dam is your addiction to kratom. No matter what else is going on in your life, the biggest brick is kratom. This is because addictions have a singularly negative impact on any other problem in your life. When you are serving out a mental prison sentence to a drug, every responsibility in your life loses priority to maintaining the drug habit. Addictive drugs demand obedience and loyalty. It doesn’t matter if you have bills to pay, family to visit, or a deadline at your job. The drug comes first. And when the drug comes first, everything else comes last. That is the nature of addiction. Is it the nature of mental slavery. When maintaining and expensive, debilitating drug addiction is top of your priority list, every other responsibility you have, whether to face a challenge or to enjoy leisure time, is ignored to some degree. 
Instead of being a miracle crutch to help us deal with our problems, kratom has made all of our problems worse. When we fail to meet our responsibilities, not only do we allow extant problems to fester, but we create new problems in addition. Addiction narrows down the list of activities we participate in. It has to. We cannot keep up with a wide variety of exploits when there is only one true priority on our to-do list. Any activities that jeopardize our chances of getting kratom will be nixed from our schedule. We do less because we have less disposable income. We go out less because we don’t want to be caught downing a cupful of powder in the bathroom. We start keeping secrets about our visits to smoke shops and gas stations from the people we live with. When people comment about the bags under our eyes and how tired we look, we lie and say we’re sick or are dealing with an inordinate amount of stress. Kratom turns addicts into alternative versions of their true selves. We may look the same on the outside, but inside, we’ve become prisoners. And all the problems in our lives that we tried to escape from in the early days of our addiction loom as large as ever. Larger, in fact, due to the debilitating knock-on effect of putting a drug habit at the top of our priority list.
Think back to that dam. Think about how big that brick of addiction really is in comparison to the bricks (problems) around it. These are likely the problems you started taking kratom to avoid in the first place. These are problems you might have solved if you hadn’t become addicted. And these are problems that almost certainly have grown in size since you became an addict. But if that’s true, then this is actually excellent news, for two reasons.
Firstly, we’ve established that simply by removing the brick of addiction from the dam, so much good will flow into your life immediately that the valley below will be restored to its natural state. Your mood will improve. Your strength will return. Your finances will shore up. Your self-respect will return. Your health, energy, stamina, and mental clarity will come back in spades. From a biological and financial standpoint, you will be exponentially better off as soon as that brick of addiction is removed. You will be refreshed and back to the person you were before the poison of addiction. And you will have gained an incredibly powerful piece of wisdom in the process: you will know that any miracle cure is actually a devil in disguise, waiting to take you captive and make you its slave. And you will be able to avoid its traps in the future. 
Secondly, the size of every other brick in the face of the dam will have shrunk considerably. Make no mistake, there is not a single problem in your life that will be as imposing after you quit kratom as it was when you were addicted. Every problem you face will return to its rightful size, a smaller and much less scary version of what it seemed when a drug was at the top of your priority list. This is the nature of quitting an addiction. All the problems that were exacerbated during and because of the addiction will be shells of their former selves. And, without your addiction, you’ll be in better shape that you’ve been in since even the early days of taking kratom. 
This is a powerful one-two punch. With a fresh perspective on just how small the problems you face are compared to the specter of addiction, you’ll know full well that if you can tackle them. Seriously, do not underestimate just how much confidence you will feel as a person who has beaten an addiction. Those who escape the drugs trap and free themselves from mental slavery are among the most mentally powerful people on the planet. Whatever the problems were that you were trying to escape by taking kratom, they will simply crumble in the face of your conquering your addiction. Because you’ll know full well that absolutely nothing is worse than the addiction you quit. Problems that were fierce lions when you were in the depths of kratom addiction will be kittens to you. You’ll wonder how they could have ever seemed so scary. Instead, you’ll see the problem for what it is, face-value. You’ll rise to meet it. And you’ll know that, no matter what, it can never beat you. Not for long, and certainly not for good. You’ve faced a far deadlier challenge and come out on top. 
All of the good things waiting for you in your life are ready to flow. The valley of your life that has dried out due to the brick dam of problems is primed for reinvigoration. You don’t need to solve all your problems at once. Indeed, the dam will never fully be de-bricked. And it doesn’t need to be. There is more than enough good to give your life vibrancy without having a problem-free life. But the quickest way to restore that valley to health is to remove the biggest brick in the dam, the brick of addiction. Remove that one, and every other problem in your life will shrink. Remove that one, and you will grow taller and stronger than you’ve ever been. '''
